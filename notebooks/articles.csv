1,2018-05-03,Hawaii Poised to Ban Sale of Some Sunscreens That Harm Coral,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/us/ap-us-hawaii-sunscreen-ban.html,528," HONOLULU —  Many sunscreen makers could soon be forced to change their formulas or be banned from selling the lotions in Hawaii. State lawmakers passed a measure this week that would ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate by 2021 in an effort to protect coral reefs. Scientists have found the two substances can be toxic to coral, which are a vital part of the ocean ecosystem and a popular draw for tourists. Consumers would only be allowed to buy sunscreen with the chemicals if prescribed by a health care provider, though the measure itself doesn't ban online purchases or tourists from bringing their own to Hawaii. It would become the first state to enact a ban on the chemicals if Democratic Gov. David Ige signs the bill; he has not indicated whether he will. Similar legislation failed last year, after it pitted environmental scientists against businesses and trade groups that benefit from the $2 billion market for sun care products in the U.S. This is ""a first step to help our reef and protect it from deterioration,"" said Hawaii state senator Donna Mercado Kim, a fellow Democrat who introduced the measure. Although other factors contribute to reef degradation, ""hopefully, other jurisdictions will look at this legislation and follow suit."" ""This is the first real chance that local reefs have to recover,"" said Craig Downs, a scientist whose 2015 peer-reviewed study found oxybenzone was a threat to coral reefs. ""Lots of things kill coral reefs, but we know oxybenzone prevents them from coming back."" It also affects sea urchins and kills algae, a source of food for sea turtles, he said. He found as much as 14,000 tons of sunscreen lotion ends up in coral reefs annually. Opponents are skeptical of the science. ""What we're really concerned with is that there aren't very many independent studies out there that have gone for peer review,"" said Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii. She said the ban might discourage people from buying sunscreen products from local brick-and-mortar stores. The American Chemistry Council also opposed the bill, citing concerns over the dangers of sun exposure. ""It's a feel good measure,"" said Democrat Sharon Har, one of four lawmakers who voted against the bill. ""Yes, we must protect the environment -- it is our number one resource -- but at the end of the day, studies have pointed to global warming, human contact, coastal development"" as other significant threats to coral. Many manufacturers already sell ""reef-friendly"" sunscreens, and companies can deplete current inventory ahead of the ban in 2021, Downs said. Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen lotions, said it makes products free of the two chemicals. The company ""will continue to ensure we comply with all relevant regulations concerning oxybenzone and octinoxate."" ""We have so many problems with coral bleaching, and there is already so much contamination,"" said Dr. Yuanan Lu, a professor and director of the environmental health laboratory at the University of Hawaii, who applauded the passage. ""We have so many people who come to Hawaii, and some of the sunscreen ingredients can be toxic, harmful to marine systems."""
2,2018-05-03,Giuliani: Trump Repaid Cohen $130K for Payment to Porn Star,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/us/politics/ap-us-trump-porn-star-.html,1087," WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer for $130,000 in hush money paid to a porn actress days before the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys, said Wednesday, appearing to contradict the president's past claims that he didn't know the source of the money. During an appearance on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity,"" Giuliani said the money to repay Michael Cohen had been ""funneled ... through the law firm and the president repaid it."" Asked if Trump knew about the arrangement, Giuliani said: ""He didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this for my clients. I don't burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people."" The comments appeared to contradict statements made by Trump several weeks ago, when he said he didn't know about the payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement she signed days before the presidential election. Giuliani later suggested to The Wall Street Journal that while Trump had repaid the $130,000, Cohen had settled the payment to Daniels without Trump's knowledge at the time. Guiliani's revelation seemed aimed at reducing the president's legal exposure. But outside experts said it raised a number of questions, including whether the money represented repayment of an undisclosed loan or could be seen as reimbursement for a campaign expenditure. Asked aboard Air Force One last month whether he knew about the payment, Trump said flatly: ""No."" Trump also said he didn't know why Cohen had made the payment or where he got the money. In a phone interview with ""Fox and Friends"" last week, however, Trump appeared to muddy the waters, saying that Cohen represented him in the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal."" The White House referred questions to the president's personal legal team. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and ex-U.S. attorney who joined Trump's legal team last month, said the president had repaid Cohen over several months, indicating the payments continued through at least the presidential transition, if not into his presidency. He also said the payment ""is going to turn out to be perfectly legal"" because ""that money was not campaign money."" No debt to Cohen is listed on Trump's personal financial disclosure form, which was certified on June 16, 2017. Giuliani also described the payment to Daniels as ""a very regular thing for lawyers to do."" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called the comment ""a stunning revelation."" ""Mr. Trump evidently has participated in a felony and there must be serious consequences for his conduct and his lies and deception to the American people,"" he said. Giuliani made the statements to Fox host Sean Hannity, who has his own connection to the case. It was recently revealed in court that Hannity is one of Cohen's clients. Hannity has described his personal dealings with Cohen as centered on real estate advice and said that it ""never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions."" Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, months after his third wife gave birth to his youngest child, and was paid to keep quiet as part of a nondisclosure agreement she is now seeking to invalidate. She has also filed a defamation suit against Trump after he questioned a composite sketch she released of a man she says threatened her to stay quiet. The White House has said Trump denies having a relationship with Daniels. Cohen had said previously: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" He notably did not include the president personally. Asked about Cohen's denial, Giuliani said that he didn't know whether Cohen had made the payment without asking Trump but that he had ""no reason to dispute that."" The revelation from Giuliani came as Cohen was under escalating legal pressure. He is facing a criminal investigation in New York, and FBI agents raided his home and office several weeks ago seeking records about the nondisclosure agreement. Daniels' lawsuit over the hush deal has been delayed, with the judge citing the criminal investigation. The payment to Daniels has raised numerous legal questions, including whether it was an illegal campaign contribution and, now, loan. ""If this is true then it looks like Cohen may have made an unreported loan to the campaign rather than a contribution,"" said Richard L. Hasen, an expert in election law at the University of California, Irvine. He said that might be better for Cohen, but not for Trump, because it undermines the argument that Cohen was acting independently. ""The greatest significance is that it implicates the president directly,"" he said. Law firms advance expenses for clients as a matter of course, and so there's nothing inherently improper about a lawyer covering a particular payment and then being reimbursed for it. In this case, though, the client who apparently reimbursed the expense was running for president and the money was paid just days before the election, raising questions about whether Cohen's law practice was functioning as a vendor for the campaign and whether the expense was therefore an unreported campaign expenditure. If so, that could be legally problematic. Andrew Herman, an attorney specializing in campaign finance law at Miller & Chevalier, said Giuliani's argument that this was a private payment unrelated to the campaign appears to be ""pretty far-fetched"" given the timing — weeks before the election while Trump was under fire for his behavior with women and for an ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which he spoke of groping women without their consent. But if Cohen or Trump could establish that discussions with Daniels over the payment long predated his run for office, that could help them with the argument that the money was a personal rather than political expense. ""It obviously increases the president's exposure to potential campaign finance violations, but it also makes him look terrible,"" said Sol Wisenberg, a defense attorney who was a deputy independent counsel during the Starr special counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. ""I don't understand the Giuliani strategy,"" he added. ""Maybe it's been too long since he's been in the criminal justice field."" ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Jonathan Lemire and Eric Tucker contributed to this report."
3,2018-05-03,Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Cohen for Stormy Daniels Hush Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels-giuliani.html,1351," WASHINGTON — President Trump reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to keep a pornographic film actress from going public before the 2016 election with her story about an affair with Mr. Trump, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers. That statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] Asked specifically last month by reporters aboard Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said, “No,” and referred questions to Mr. Cohen. He was then asked, “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?” “No,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t know.” In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president’s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it “on his own authority.” “Some time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account,” Mr. Giuliani said. He added that over all, Mr. Cohen was paid $460,000 or $470,000 from Mr. Trump through those payments, which also included money for “incidental expenses” that he had incurred on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen, suggesting, as Mr. Giuliani had, that the payment to Ms. Clifford was not a campaign contribution. The president has repeatedly denied that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford, who has described having intimate contact with Mr. Trump before he became president. Mr. Giuliani’s comments are also in direct contrast to what Mr. Cohen has been saying for months — that he used his own money to pay Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen is under investigation by the F.B.I., which raided his home and office last month and seized documents that included information about the payment to Ms. Clifford. “They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,” Mr. Giuliani told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. After Mr. Hannity asked for clarification, Mr. Giuliani insisted: “That was money that was paid by his lawyer. The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.” The source of the $130,000 payment is at the center of several legal disputes involving Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford. That includes whether the payment to Ms. Clifford was in effect a contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign aimed at preventing a negative article from surfacing just before Election Day. Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Cohen had “settled several problems for” Mr. Trump, and that the payment related to them. Another person familiar with the payment confirmed that that was the mechanism used to repay Mr. Cohen. Mr. Giuliani said that he was “not clear that” Mr. Trump was aware of the payment to Ms. Clifford at the time it was made, and he said that his understanding was that the president did not learn about the payment to her until recently. “I don’t think he did” know “until now,” Mr. Giuliani said. The comments on Fox sent a jolt through Washington and New York, including the legal teams working on behalf of the president, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who has sued Mr. Cohen in an attempt to be released from the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment in October 2016. Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, said Wednesday night on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani’s comments amounted to an admission that the president had lied to the American people about whether he was aware of the hush payment. “Mr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,” Mr. Avenatti wrote. “This followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America. We will not rest until justice is served.” In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said a key issue going forward would be how Mr. Trump accounted for any such payment and whether it was hidden in a way that could violate anti-money laundering statutes. Mr. Giuliani’s statement to Mr. Hannity was the latest of several contradictory narratives from Mr. Trump’s representatives about the deal to pay Ms. Clifford for her silence during the campaign, each of which have had potential implications for violating campaign finance disclosure laws. Mr. Cohen had previously provided a detailed account of how he had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket, drawing down on a home loan to do so. That opened Mr. Cohen and the Trump campaign to charges that he violated the law by exceeding the amount that an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. If Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, that could help Mr. Cohen and the campaign avoid prosecution for violating campaign contribution limits because a candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to his own campaign. According to a person close to the president, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, a determination made in recent weeks by the president’s lawyers after examining banking records. The lawyers determined that campaign funds had not been used for the payment, the person said. The lawyers also concluded that the funds did not come from a third party or the Trump Organization, the person said. While the disclosure may be embarrassing for the president, his lawyers believe the payment did not violate campaign finance laws, the person said. Another person familiar with the payment to Mr. Cohen from Mr. Trump said the money was reimbursed in a series of payments, not in a lump sum. But such a payment from the candidate — even if it was made through a lawyer — would have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as an in-kind contribution to the campaign and as an expenditure by the campaign, if it was for the purpose of influencing the election. Mr. Trump’s campaign did not disclose the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen on its commission reports. The crucial question in determining whether the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance laws might be whether the payment was specifically intended to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. Paul S. Ryan, an official at the government watchdog group Common Cause, argued that “all the facts indicate that the payment was to influence the election.” Mr. Ryan asserted that Mr. Giuliani’s admission could allow prosecutors to make the case that Mr. Trump “knowingly caused his campaign committee to file an incomplete disclosure report with the F.E.C.” “Until tonight, it would have been tough to prove that because Donald Trump had denied knowing about the payment,” Mr. Ryan said. “But his reimbursement amounts to knowledge.” While most violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act’s disclosure provisions are misdemeanors, a knowing and willful violation could be a felony. But Mr. Giuliani’s comments could cloud Mr. Avenatti’s legal argument that his client should be formally released from the hush agreement she signed. When the president told reporters he knew nothing about the deal, he helped Ms. Clifford’s case that the hush agreement was not binding if Mr. Trump did not know about it and did not sign it. Though far from bringing clarity to the question, Mr. Giuliani obscured it further — now two lawyers for the president are providing two very different versions of events."
4,2018-05-03,Malaysia's Ex-PM Mahathir Under Investigation for Fake News,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/asia/ap-as-malaysia-fake-news.html,466," KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia —  Malaysian former strongman Mahathir Mohamad, who heads an opposition alliance in next week's national elections, has brushed off concerns that he is under investigation for spreading false news. Kuala Lumpur police have said they are investigating Mahathir under a new law banning fake news after complaints over Mahathir's claim that his chartered plane was sabotaged last week to prevent him from filing his candidacy in the northern resort island of Langkawi. Mahathir, who was premier for 22 years until his retirement in 2003, said late Wednesday he isn't worried about the police probe. ""They can use whatever (law). I'm not afraid of any investigations. I have been investigated many number of times,"" he told reporters after a late-night rally in the central state of Pahang. The law, which was rushed through parliament last month just days before election was called, carries a stiff penalty of up to six years in jail and a fine of 500,000 ringgit ($128,000). Critics say it is aimed at silencing dissent ahead of the May 9 general election. On Monday, a Danish citizen became the first person to be convicted under the law for making false claims over the killing of a Hamas militant on a video he posted on YouTube. Mahathir, 92, has said he believed there was a ""deliberate attempt"" to stop him from going to Langkawi last Friday after the pilot found some damage to the jet just before departure. He said he tried to source for other planes but was rejected by three people, including one who claimed he was under pressure. Mahathir eventually found a plane and made it to the island to register Saturday for the polls. ""We are dealing with a government party which is known to use all kinds of tricks in order to win the election. And one of the tricks, of course, is to stop me from being nominated, and especially me, because I happened to be the leader of the opposition,"" he wrote on his blog. ""So I maintain my belief that the plane was deliberately tampered with to stop me from going to Langkawi."" The Civil Aviation Authority said its investigation found no evidence of sabotage and the private plane company said it was a technical issue related to the front wheel. Prime Minister Najib Razak slammed Mahathir for making irresponsible allegations and urged him to stop his ""politics of lying."" Mahathir made a political comeback amid anger over a massive corruption scandal involving the 1MDB state fund that was set up by Najib but accumulated billions in debts and is being investigated for money laundering in the U.S. and other countries. Mahathir has galvanized a fractured opposition and become their prime minister candidate, in the strongest bid to oust Najib and his long-ruling coalition."
5,2018-05-03,UBS Seeks Regulatory Nod for 51 Percent Controlling Stake in China JV,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-ubs-group-china.html,188," SHANGHAI/BEIJING —  UBS Group is looking for a controlling stake in its China joint venture, UBS Securities Co, after the country's securities regulator announced new rules earlier this year easing restrictions on foreign ownership of brokerages. UBS Securities has submitted an application to the regulator seeking approval for UBS to raise its stake in the JV to 51 percent, UBS said in an emailed statement on Thursday. It currently has about a 25 percent stake in the JV, UBS Securities' website shows. Previously, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities JVs. The lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is reviewing UBS' application, the statement added. ""The further opening up of China's financial sector represents great opportunities for our China businesses, including investment banking, wealth management and asset management,"" a spokeswoman said in the statement. While restrictions have eased, some Western banks fear high asset-value requirements and limits to ownership by non-financial investors could stymie broad participation.

6,2018-05-03,Richemont Technology Chief Quits Amid Online Sales Push,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-richemont-cto.html,479," ZURICH —  Cartier-owner Richemont's technology chief Jean-Jacques Van Oosten is leaving after only four months in the job, during which the Swiss group bid for control of online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter to boost web sales. Richemont and luxury goods peers are seeking to ramp up e-commerce operations and attract younger shoppers, as online sales become one of the industry's fastest growth drivers. Richemont, which also owns watchmaker IWC and fashion label Chloe, hired Van Oosten for the newly-created technology role as part of this drive, alongside a former LVMH human resources director with a tech-savvy profile. Shortly after Van Oosten started in January, the group announced a 2.8 billion euro (2.5 billion pounds) bid for full control of Milan-based YNAP, putting the multi-brand retailer at the centre of its e-commerce efforts. The shifting backdrop at the company following Van Oosten's appointment was linked to his departure, a source close to the company said on Thursday, adding Richemont's focus on boosting its digital presence was unchanged. Richemont declined to comment further on Van Oosten's exit, saying only the executive, who had previously worked at companies including Tesco and Unilever, was leaving for personal reasons. Over the last two years, the group has undergone a major management overhaul, replacing almost all of its brand heads, with new CEOs at watch brands Jaeger-LeCoultre and Baume & Mercier announced just last week. Also last week, Richemont nominated Alain Zimmermann, up to now CEO of its Baume & Mercier watch brand, to head e-commerce operations at the group's watch brands from June 1. Richemont did not say whether Van Oosten would be replaced. He was also a member of the now seven-strong senior executive committee that leads Richemont, which has abolished the role of group CEO. ""I presume Richemont will leverage Yoox Net-a-Porter's expertise to scale and internationalise its online and multichannel platforms, which was something Van Oosten was originally hired for,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said. Luxury goods manufacturers have only belatedly pursued online growth, with many brands initially wary of an e-commerce world which they believed might make their products seem less exclusive. But most are now playing catch-up, either building out their own websites where they can tightly control their image, or collaborating with third-parties sites such as Farfetch and MatchesFashion. France's LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, opted to develop its own multi-brand platform, 24 Sevres, in one of its most eye-catching initiatives since hiring former Apple music executive Ian Rogers in 2015 as digital chief. YNAP said in April it was launching a dedicated section for the sale of high-end jewellery - one of Richemont's fortes. One challenge for the two groups as YNAP moves in-house will be to hold onto other clients that collaborate with the platform.

7,2018-05-03,New Volkswagen CEO Vows Integrity Drive but Investors Unimpressed,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-volkswagen-agm.html,579," BERLIN —  Volkswagen's new chief executive on Thursday vowed to make the carmaker ""more honest"" as it fights to recover from 2015's diesel emissions scandal, but its wary investors called for outside vetting of steps to restore its reputation. Europe's largest automaker will expand its internal whistleblower system and beef up compliance to prevent the misconduct that triggered the scandal, CEO Herbert Diess said. ""Volkswagen has to become more honest, more open, more truthful,"" Diess said at VW's annual shareholder meeting. Preventing future malfeasance ""is the top priority for my colleagues on the (management) board and for me personally."" Former chief executive Matthias Mueller, who was ousted last month by the carmaker's major shareholders, has said getting mid-level managers to adapt to the carmaker's post-dieselgate drive to improve accountability was more difficult than thought. ""We have too long underestimated the value of a more open corporate culture that does not repress dissent but instead rewards it,"" Diess said. Investors welcomed the planned changes but said home-grown steps alone would not suffice to credibly overhaul VW's corporate culture. Beyond a new code of conduct for employees and tighter rules for vehicle engineers, there has been ""little tangible progress (at VW) that credibly shows to investors that changes to the corporate culture are advancing,"" Michael Viehs of investment advisory firm Hermes EOS said. ""We therefore urgently recommend the supervisory board to carry out an independent assessment of corporate culture."" Winfried Mathes of Deka Investment agreed. ""While the management board is getting the operating business back on course for the future, the company's corporate governance remains in the stone age. We still believe that a genuinely new start also requires a really independent supervisory board chairman."" Separately, Diess said VW had so far picked partners to provide battery cells and related technology worth around 40 billion euros (35.3 billion pounds) for its electric-car programme, four-fifths of the planned volume of 50 billion euros. The battery technology will be destined for Europe and China where VW sells 80 percent of its vehicles, while a supplier for North America has yet to be chosen, a source close to VW said. VW's huge battery buy contrasts with U.S. electric-car pioneer Tesla's struggle to convince investors it has enough cash to go the distance. Tesla on Wednesday posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss as it grappled with production issues on its Model 3 sedan. Diess on Thursday renewed his call on the industry to step up talks about jointly making battery cells in Europe as peers are pushing their electric-vehicle lineups. VW is still looking at whether to spin off assets such as motorcycle maker Ducati and transmissions maker Renk, Diess said, as the autos group strives to streamline its operations and become more efficient. Under former CEO Matthias Mueller, attempts to slim down the group by selling Ducati and Renk floundered amid opposition from labour leaders and the controlling Porsche and Piech families. ""For non-core businesses such as Ducati, Renk and (large engines unit) MAN Diesel & Turbo, we will draw up sustainable future plans,"" Diess said. The deliberations could lead to expanding those businesses and developing growth strategies, but spin-offs ""are also conceivable"", he added. Since the former BMW executive took office on April 12, Volkswagen (VW) has announced steps to prepare its truck operations for a possible stock market listing and to reorganise its multiple car brands in an effort to boost synergies.

8,2018-05-03,A Fast-Food Problem: Where Have All the Teenagers Gone?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/upshot/fast-food-jobs-teenagers-shortage.html,1032," A quarter-century ago, there were 56 teenagers in the labor force for every “limited service” restaurant — that is, the kind where you order at the counter. Today, there are fewer than half as many, which is a reflection both of teenagers’ decreasing work force participation and of the explosive growth in restaurants. But in an industry where cheap labor is an essential component in providing inexpensive food, a shortage of workers is changing the equation upon which fast-food places have long relied. This can be seen in rising wages, in a growth of incentives, and in the sometimes odd situations that business owners find themselves in. This is why Jeffrey Kaplow, for example, spends a lot of time working behind the counter in his Subway restaurant in Lower Manhattan. It’s not what he pictured himself doing, but he simply doesn’t have enough employees. Mr. Kaplow has tried everything he can think of to find workers, placing Craigslist ads, asking other franchisees for referrals, seeking to hire people from Subways that have closed. Yet there he was during a recent lunchtime rush, ringing up veggie footlongs and fountain drinks. He feared that if the line grew too long, people might get frustrated and not come back. “Every time there’s a huge line, the next day the store is nowhere near as busy,” he explained later as he straightened tables and swept up crumbs. Across the country, Keith Miller, another franchisee, is dealing with the same problem. “What employees? We don’t have them anymore,” joked Mr. Miller, who can’t find enough workers for the three Subways he owns in Northern California. Since 2010, fast-food jobs have grown nearly twice as fast as employment over all, contributing to the economic recovery. But rapid growth has created new problems. Some say restaurants have grown faster than demand, causing a glut of competition that is another source of pressure on business owners. Restaurant owners are also worrying about increased immigration enforcement: Nearly 20 percent of workers are foreign-born. With unemployment at a 17-year low, businesses everywhere are struggling to find workers. Fast food is feeling the pinch acutely, especially as one important source of workers has dried up. In 2000, about 45 percent of those between 16 and 19 had a job — today it’s 30 percent. “We used to get overwhelmed with the number of people wanting summer jobs,” Mr. Miller said, adding that he now gets maybe a handful of such applications, at most. “I don’t know what teenagers do all summer.” Gavin Poole, a 17-year-old senior at Montville Township High School in New Jersey, likes the idea of being his own boss — that’s one reason he created a small business out of after-school landscaping and handyman work. The money has helped cover his cellphone bill and the payments on the Jeep Wrangler he leased last year. “I want to be prepared for the future, because you don’t know, financially, what situation you could be in,” he said. A recent analysis by economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that an increased emphasis on education — and getting scholarships — had contributed to the decline in working teenagers, reflecting both the rising costs of education and the low wages most people that age can earn. Now, after years of benefiting from low-cost labor, many employers are starting to pay more. Fast-food wages began rising in 2014, and have increased faster than overall wages since. But at $10.93 an hour, the pay is still less than half the average for an hourly employee, pushing companies to offer more incentives — like dental insurance, sign-up bonuses and even travel reimbursement — to entice workers. That’s good news for workers like Juan Morales, who has assembled sandwiches at a Subway on Staten Island for more than 15 years. “It’s much better than before,” said Mr. Morales, who earns a little more than $15 an hour. “But for my boss, I see that it’s harder.” Restaurants are notorious for churning through employees. But people are coming and going faster than they have in recent memory, according to data from TDn2K, a restaurant research firm. Last year, the turnover rate reached 133 percent, meaning that positions often had to be filled more than once. That has forced business owners to adjust. Tamra Kennedy, who owns nine Taco John’s franchises in the Midwest, started offering $100 as a bonus to new employees who reached 100 hours. She has started offering merit increases twice a year, and she pays all employees more than the minimum wage. “Hiring has been more challenging in the last two years than probably the previous 10,” Ms. Kennedy said. About half of her stores are understaffed. So she has devised workarounds: Digital probes, not people, now record food temperatures. She has also invested in expensive new registers that can produce reports that employees used to do by hand. “I’ve never seen the industry in this kind of situation,” said Robert S. Goldin, a partner at the food consulting firm Pentallect. “It’s never been like this.” Labor costs are rising, according to an estimate from Dean Haskell, a partner at National Retail Concept Partners, a restaurant and retail consulting firm in Denver. Mr. Haskell analyzed public financial filings from 15 major chains and determined that those companies spent about $73 million more on labor last year than the year before. McDonald’s has announced that it will expand its tuition-reimbursement program, committing $150 million over five years to tuition reimbursement for employees who work at its stores for at least 90 days. Before, the requirement was nine months. That $150 million might seem like a lot. But replacing workers is also expensive: It costs about $2,000 to replace the average hourly restaurant worker, according to data from TDn2K. “Thirty years ago, I would not put up with the stuff I put up with today,” said John Motta, a longtime Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in Nashua, N.H. When an employee recently missed a shift, one of his stores could serve only drive-through customers for about an hour. “You try not to be too harsh on them,” he said, “because you’re afraid tomorrow they’re not going to show up.”"
9,2018-05-03,Trump’s Solar Tariffs Cause a Scramble in the Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/business/energy-environment/solar-industry-tariffs.html,1184," SunPower is the nation’s No. 2 commercial solar-power company, employing thousands of workers directly and indirectly. But it makes most of its solar panels abroad, and with the tariffs recently imposed by President Trump costing it as much as $2 million a week, SunPower is fighting for an exemption. One of its rivals, SolarWorld Americas, produces panels domestically. Buffeted by foreign competition, it was behind the original push for the tariffs. Now the two American companies are merging. It’s all part of the disruption, distortion and uncertainty from an escalating trade offensive aimed primarily at China. In barely three months, the tariffs — the first shot fired by Mr. Trump in that campaign — are fundamentally reshaping the solar industry and its prospects. A Chinese player announced plans to open a factory in Florida as early as this fall. With its SolarWorld acquisition, SunPower moved to prevent further loss to its business by locating a bigger share of its production in the United States. Both companies are being hit with tariffs on high-efficiency panels they produce in Malaysia. Those efforts only blunt the negative effects of the industry fallout. While producing more panels in the United States will create a few hundred jobs, the tariffs could cost tens of thousands, largely on the installation side of the business. Dozens of solar companies are now petitioning to be exempted from the tariffs, and a bipartisan group in Congress has introduced a bill to overturn them altogether. “I think that any action that brings new investment to the United States is welcome,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But the tariffs have slowed down the growth of our industry. The growth has been muted, and that means jobs are not being created.” Her group said the tariffs could cost as many as 23,000 American jobs this year. In addition, the 30 percent tariffs are going to make it more expensive for cities across the country to pursue their goal of promoting solar power as a way to curb carbon pollution. The solar industry expects to continue adding installations, but growth is estimated to be about 11 percent lower than projections before the tariffs. Those diminished prospects are what prompted SunPower to bulk up its operations by pursuing the purchase of SolarWorld, based in Hillsboro, Ore. “We understand the goal of the American people and the goal of this administration,” said Tom Werner, SunPower’s chief executive. “We decided that we will be a leader, and we will take a bold move and buy an American enterprise.” The office of the United States trade representative, which is handling the tariffs, is reviewing the requests from SunPower and other companies for exemptions. No time frame for a decision has been set. To be excluded, the companies must show that they have a unique technology or offering. SunPower, based in San Jose, Calif., said its products served a need unmet by existing American manufacturers, and were made overseas for proximity to its suppliers, largely in Asia, making the solar panels cheaper. “We’re kind of collateral damage,” Mr. Werner said of the tariffs. The upheaval extends to the consumers of solar products, not just the makers. “The industry is in a scramble to figure out what all of the impacts are,” said Rob Freeman, chief executive of Tradewind Energy, which is based in Kansas outside Kansas City and develops industrial-scale solar and wind projects. “I think it’s fair to say it could be worse. I think it’s fair to say it’s a significant negative.” The effect of the tariffs on the cost of imported solar panels makes it more difficult to compete with other sources of power like wind, or even makes fossil-fuel plants look attractive again, Mr. Freeman said. “It tips it back in favor of other alternatives,” he added. And then there are the jobs. SunPower, which is taking over an operation with 280 employees, said it had not determined how many jobs it might add, the company said. JinkoSolar, a Shanghai company, announced this year that it would start manufacturing in Jacksonville, Fla., and create about 200 jobs. It already has a deal with Florida-based NextEra Energy to supply the parent company of Florida’s largest utility with seven million panels over four years — one of the largest orders to date. JinkoSolar said it still needed exclusion from the tariffs to bring any significant scale to its American operations. While it will assemble panels in the United States, the solar cells will continue to be produced in Asia and subject to tariffs. “We would not expand it if we don’t get allowed tariff-free cells,” said Nigel Cockroft, the company’s United States general manager. Even as those projects bring prospective jobs, the Solar Energy Industries Association pointed to the potential job losses from the suspension or termination of solar projects because of higher costs. It said domestic operations alone could not meet the previous level of demand. “In some ways, this is showing that the tariff is having some kind of effect, but it doesn’t necessarily grow the U.S. manufacturing market,” said MJ Shiao, global lead for renewables and emerging technologies at Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm with United States headquarters in Houston. “The projects no longer pencil out,” Mr. Shiao said. Solar energy enjoyed a banner year in 2016, when there was a rush to get projects going before a federal tax credit on solar projects was to expire. In that year, it became the nation’s leading source of new electricity generation. But after that flurry, solar yielded its No. 1 spot even though Congress extended the 30 percent tax credit through 2019. Now the tariffs have added another bump in the road for solar power. Before the tariffs, the industry was expected to have the capacity to power 13.7 million homes nationwide by 2022, according to the solar industry group. That estimate has been revised downward by more than 10 percent. “There might be some places where solar would have won for new generation that now might revert back to wind or natural gas,” Mr. Shiao said. “In some cases nothing is going to fill that void.” Ms. Hopper of the industry group said she hoped that Congress would repeal the tariffs with a bill now before lawmakers. Representative Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, introduced the bill out of concern over the loss of jobs in her state. Two South Carolina Republicans, Representatives Mark Sanford and Ralph Norman, backed the legislation, citing not only jobs but also the added cost the tariffs imposed on business. The bipartisan nature of the effort gives the industry hope that it might find support. Solar power, which now generates almost 2 percent of the nation’s electricity, has become popular among Democrats and Republicans alike, as people consider ways to have more control over their energy use and to reduce pollution as well as create jobs. “We think that the industry will continue to grow,” Ms. Hopper said. “I think that the outlook is still positive but not quite as positive as it could be.”"
10,2018-05-03,Rukmini Callimachi on Audio’s Power to Reveal the Truth of the ‘Caliphate’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/insider/rukmini-callimachi-caliphate-interview.html,2174," Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. “Who are they?” This seemingly simple question drives “Caliphate,” The Times’s first documentary audio series, as Rukmini Callimachi, a foreign correspondent, searches for a deeper understanding of the Islamic State. “Caliphate” debuted in April, with Ms. Callimachi, who has covered Al Qaeda and ISIS for The Times since 2014, serving as its guide, deftly aided by the producer Andy Mills. Their 10-part series centers on the story of “Abu Huzayfah,” a former ISIS member living in Canada who, like many jihadists, uses a nom de guerre. The podcast complements “The ISIS Files,” Ms. Callimachi’s investigation into thousands of internal Islamic State documents that her team recovered from Iraq. New chapters of “Caliphate” are released every Thursday afternoon, and subscribers can listen a week early. I recently interviewed Ms. Callimachi about the challenges posed by reporting on ISIS for audio, the first episodes of the podcast and the ethical dilemmas of her beat. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. How has working with audio made you approach reporting differently? The big difference for me is that it’s very unusual and somewhat uncomfortable to write in the first person. This is something you do in exceptional circumstances when the reporter’s story is important as a vehicle for telling the larger story. When you’re doing audio, the fact that you’re the vehicle telling the story is built in. That makes it much easier to inform listeners about the reporting process. For example, last year, Andy and I were in Iraq for “The Daily” to report the story of young women who had just been released after three years of ISIS captivity and, in some instances, had been raped almost every day. In the middle of the day, we walked into the tent of two of the women and saw them collapsed, lying on mattresses. There were people wailing and crying over them. As soon as I saw that, I turned to Andy and said: “We’ve got to leave. We have no business being here. These people are really sick.” A lot of listeners commented on how powerful it was to hear that because they probably hadn’t thought about the ethical considerations that go into interviewing rape victims. In a text story, I might have described that there were two women who were collapsed, but the fact that I had to leave because it would have been obscene for me to try to interview them would not have gotten in. My beat is among the more unusual ones we have at The Times. It’s intense, and you’re dealing with these ethical quandaries all the time. My editors and I have many long discussions about how we do this and how we approach that. With audio you have the ability to be transparent about those considerations and walk listeners through how we struggle with and try to make our way through them. What do you see as the main advantages of audio over the written word? One of the subjects of the podcast is a young Canadian recruit to ISIS. If I were to pitch a text story based entirely on somebody identified by essentially his made-up name, that would be a hard sell. But with audio, you understand implicitly that this is his story. I don’t want to give away what happens later in the podcast, but there are some really emotional moments. You can hear the trauma in his voice and the emotion of him recalling what happened. There’s a point where he’s describing something particularly awful and we have the microphone very close to his face. You hear him rubbing his hand on his beard back and forth, and you understand that this is somebody who feels really distressed, really nervous. I could write that — “he rubbed his beard” — but it doesn’t come across the same way. I don’t want to diminish text in any way. That will always be my medium. But audio is a different form, so it has power in a different register. Many of the most popular serialized podcasts revolve around a single host who becomes part of the narrative. What went into the decision to feature both you and Andy? From the beginning we wanted to experiment with new ways of telling stories with this podcast. We got rid of the “host” role to provoke more spontaneity in our dialogue and hopefully more intimacy with our listeners. I loved working with Andy from the start. He comes from an evangelical background and grew up in a religious family, but later left the faith. He remains very curious about religion, and so much with ISIS involves faith and belief. We hit it off right away. It was really nice to have him as this sort of co-detective and be able to bounce things off him. Shortly after “Caliphate” debuted, it reached the top of the Apple Podcast chart. What elements do you think have made it resonate so strongly with listeners? One of the things is that Andy, in a way, gave me permission to really be myself and to be honest about what it’s like to be on this beat. I’ve always been worried about showing my vulnerabilities and telling people when I feel scared because, in the end, I’m a woman covering terrorism, and I just assume that there are people who think I can’t hack it. For example, when I was first telling Andy about the 911 call, I asked him to turn off the recorder. Later, he convinced me to put it on the record in Chapter 1. I really wrestled with it: Do I want people to know this insane thing I did — that I called 911 in the middle of the night because I thought ISIS might be ringing my doorbell? But I think Andy was right. Allowing myself to be human and to explain what it’s really like as a woman on this beat works, and is interesting for listeners. You frequently correspond with readers on Twitter and have invited listeners of “Caliphate” to direct message you. Based on their responses to the series, do you think you’ve reached a new audience? I really do, and that’s the exciting thing about audio. In journalism, at a certain point, you get into a lane and you get comments from people who are generally of that universe. I often get comments, for example, from journalism students, women, people who are interested in national security. Suddenly, I’m getting messages from people in Germany and in Finland who listened to the podcast, people whom I don’t normally hear from. That’s really cool. [Read this recent Twitter thread to see Ms. Callimachi’s responses to readers’ questions about her work covering ISIS.] In “Caliphate” you mention how previous interviews with ISIS members left you frustrated and made you question whether they were being truthful. Have you had similar feelings with Abu Huzayfah? I would have to spoil a lot of things if I answered that question. In general on this beat, though, that’s the puzzle you’re always dealing with. First of all, you’re spending so much effort just trying to get even one ISIS member to talk to you. It’s so hard to find them. You can somewhat get access to them in prisons in Iraq, but you don’t get much time with them. It’s also very hard to do these interviews in 20 minutes, 30 minutes because you’re just scratching the surface. And then you have a source’s story. Imagine how hard it has been to confirm the reporting on Harvey Weinstein, and that’s happening in Hollywood, a place with a paper trail and American citizens and people who speak the same language we do. It’s so hard with ISIS because you’re dealing with a place I cannot go: the caliphate, when it was around. So half the work is just getting the interview and the other half is figuring out if there’s any way to corroborate it. Have you been contacted by any law enforcement officials who are concerned that you’re communicating with a former ISIS member in Canada? A retired Canadian intelligence analyst started tweeting at me, basically asking if I had a moral responsibility to flag this person to authorities. Obviously, as journalists, we can’t act as an extension of law enforcement. That would be the end of me on this beat if I started turning in my sources. At the same time, we are dealing with members of a terrorist group — a group that has called for attacks in North America. You’ll see later in the podcast that we found a way to keep our journalistic integrity but also answer some of these questions. What are some of the other ethical dilemmas you’ve discussed? My goal in telling the story of Abu Huzayfah is to try to explain, in a way, the unexplainable: How does a normal-seeming person, who grew up in a middle-class family, with no abuse that I know of, loving parents and a comfortable lifestyle — how does that person, because there are so many of them, end up joining this murderous group? There’s a rut in the reporting on ISIS, where it’s so easy to write about the salacious, awful things they do. Very quickly, we go into this boogeyman narrative about these savage, brutal criminals. We forget that human beings are doing this, and 40,000 people have joined from overseas. Yes, you can find the psychopaths among them. But, in my experience, there are a lot more Huzayfahs than the others. I saw part of my job as trying to explain this story and trying to do so as humanely as I could. The line that we tread there is that we come very close to this big chasm on the other side, of justifying ISIS’ acts, which we don’t want to do, of course. There was a big balancing act on that front. On the podcast you talk about how ISIS members follow you and your work on social media. Do you know if they’re listening to “Caliphate”? So far I have not seen them talking about “Caliphate.” They did message each other about the “ISIS Files” story. There was a very long post in Arabic where they said that even The New York Times basically acknowledges their statehood, which was a little funny and a little worrying. Have you finished all the episodes? We’re still working on the back end, and I think we’re going to be working up to the wire. Do you know how “Caliphate” will end? I actually don’t, to be perfectly honest. I have an idea, but there are a couple of things that might happen in the middle of the podcast that I still haven’t gotten a handle on. Will the documents that you collected for “The ISIS Files” play a role in the series? They do. They’re featured heavily in episodes seven and eight. As one of the world’s foremost experts on the Islamic State and terrorism, have you learned anything unexpected in making “Caliphate”?  I have interviewed many victims who have seen beheadings and have been on the receiving end of the brutality of the Islamic State. To hear it told from the other side — in a really detailed, naked way — was revelatory. In the videos that ISIS has put out and in the reporting that we’ve done, you see the group as bloodthirsty and hateful, and that is one reality. But there are also other realities, including people who do these acts and who have enormous remorse. What would people be surprised to find out about your reporting process? When Andy was coming with me to Iraq, I was really worried because he thought he was joining this high-flying correspondent doing something really interesting. And I was thinking to myself: “He has no idea how many hours we’re going to be sitting at a checkpoint. He has no idea how many times we’re going to start the day thinking that we’ll get X, only to get to the destination and be told that the source has left.” There’s a lot of waiting around and trying to have tea with this official to get access to this one thing, trying to schmooze with that one person to see if, even though there’s a media blackout in Mosul, you could be the only journalist who’s let in. What comes next after “Caliphate”? I adore my little team. We’re already kind of nostalgic thinking about when this is over because we won’t see each other every day anymore. But we need to finish the podcast first, and afterward I think we all need to go on a really long vacation and then come back and think about it. To hear more from Rukmini Callimachi and learn about new episodes, sign up here. If you’ve already tuned in to “Caliphate,” tell us what you think in the comments section. "
11,2018-05-03,Graphic-Stainless Steel Glut Builds in China as Indonesia Ups Output,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-stainless-glut-nickel.html,610," LONDON —  An abundance of stainless steel in China following the ramp up of new production in Indonesia is threatening stainless mills globally and the nickel producers that supply them. Marking a major structural shift, China, which makes and consumes around half of the world's stainless, became a marginal net importer of hot-rolled stainless coil in December for the first time in more than seven years, data from the International Steel Statistics Bureau and from consultants CRU showed. This is after Chinese-owned stainless giant Tsingshan started production last August at a giant plant in Indonesia that should, by the end of 2018, have an annual capacity of 3 million tonnes.This is equivalent to 6 percent of last year's global flat stainless capacity, CRU says, and there is more to come, with China's Delong Holdings set to start production at its Indonesian stainless plant in 2019. Graphic: China's Net Stainless HRC Trade - https://reut.rs/2JMj4gi ""If we look at 2021 when we have Delong and Tsingshan fully ramped up, Indonesian capacity will rise to more than 5 million tonnes, that's just under 10 percent of global capacity,"" said CRU analyst Michael Finch. He added that Tsingshan, which has a captive power source and produces its own ferrochrome and nickel pig iron - key raw materials for stainless - is an ""incredibly low cost producer"". The plant sells most of its stainless to China, where stocks have risen 80 percent since the end of December, hitting their highest in more than eight years in mid-April, according to CRU. China's stainless prices have flatlined since mid-January at around 15,500 yuan a tonne. Stainless producers beyond China are also concerned. Finland's Outokumpu reported first quarter profits more than halving on falling prices and expects more of the same this quarter. Spain's Acerinox reported a drop of 40 percent in first quarter earnings, buffeted somewhat by solid U.S. earnings. In December, Handelsbanken downgraded Outokumpu citing the ""tremendously negative"" impact from low-cost capacity in Indonesia while Jefferies says weak Asian stainless markets are weighing on Acerinox in Europe and Africa. Graphic: Acerinox, Outokumpu share price - https://reut.rs/2I6C4sN The weakness in the stainless market is also a worry for nickel producers <CMCU3>. Two-thirds of nickel demand comes from stainless mills. Benchmark London Metal Exchange nickel (LME) prices <CMNI3> rose 27 percent last year amid a ramp up in global stainless output and they are up some 10 percent this year at around $14,000 (10,290 pounds). However, should stainless price weakness persist, mills, particularly those that are loss-making, could cut production. ING said, even before operating costs are accounted for, Chinese mills are in the red as stainless prices since December have fallen below nickel prices <CMCU3>. Graphic: China stainless versus LME nickel price - https://reut.rs/2JH3mmK The global nickel market is tight, explaining some of the price strength in nickel. The International Nickel Study Group last week nearly doubled its global nickel deficit forecast for 2018 to 117,000 tonnes. LME nickel stocks <MNI-STOCKS>, at their lowest since mid-2014 and Shanghai Futures Exchange nickel stocks near their lowest since November 2015, also illustrate the tightness. <SNI-TOTAL-W> Graphic: LME, ShFE nickel stocks - https://reut.rs/2IatvNN However, Chinese media reports say stainless mills are scrambling to combat the supply glut by bringing forward maintenance schedules or switching from stainless to carbon steelmaking. ""Nickel is our preferred short at these levels, we're forecasting below $13,000 by year-end,"" said ING analyst Oliver Nugent. ""While respecting the tightness, the price is up about 25 percent since December while stainless is dead flat, pointing at concerns that prices can't be passed onto the end consumer.""

12,2018-05-03,Italy's President Calls New Government Consultations on May 7,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/europe/03reuters-italy-politics.html,495," ROME —  President Sergio Mattarella has called for a fresh round of consultations with party leaders on May 7 to try to end nine weeks of increasingly fractious political deadlock following inconclusive March elections. Mattarella has already held two rounds of talks which failed to end the stalemate while two further efforts at mediation carried out by parliamentary speakers also hit a brick wall. ""After two months, the initial positions of the parties have not changed. No prospect has emerged for a government,"" the head of state's office said in a statement, adding that the president wanted to hear if party leaders had any other ideas. Mattarella's options are rapidly dwindling and the possibility of a return to the polls sometime between the coming autumn and next spring looks increasingly likely. A national election on March 4 saw a center-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant League winning the most seats and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerging as the biggest single party. The center-left Democratic Party (PD) came third. A matrix of criss-crossing vetoes has so far prevented the parties from agreeing to a coalition deal, with friction and frustration growing by the day. Underscoring the sense of paralysis, the PD was due to decide later on Thursday whether to open formal negotiations with 5-Star. However, Mattarella did not wait for their decision before announcing Monday's meetings - an acknowledgement that the deeply divided party will be unable to agree to such a deal. Having come to the same conclusion, the leader of the 5-Star this week called for an immediate revote in June, but a source in the president's office told Reuters on Wednesday that the head of state would reject this demand. Instead, Mattarella wants to put together a stopgap government to draw up a 2019 budget that has to be approved by the end of December. If party leaders fail to sign up to such an administration, which would almost certainly be led by a non-political figure, then a new vote would be held in the autumn - probably October. The last four Italian prime ministers took office thanks to backroom deals rather than ballot-box victories and repeated efforts to reform the electoral law that would allow for the swift formation of a government have failed to come up with a winning formula. While 5-Star is pushing for an immediate re-vote, other parties have suggested working together to devise a new election system. However, winning wide backing for such a pact in the current political climate looks highly unlikely. While Italy's day-to-day administration is being overseen by caretaker prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, latest economic forecasts from the European Commission have underlined the need for a fully empowered government ready to undertake reform. The forecasts showed that the Italian economy was set to grow 1.5 percent this year and just 1.2 percent next -- the lowest amongst the European Union's 27 member states.

13,2018-05-03,Expectations Grow for North Korea to Release Three Americans,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/asia/03reuters-northkorea-usa-prisoners.html,452," WASHINGTON —  CNN said on Thursday that North Korea would imminently release three Americans held as prisoners, as expectations grew that  Pyongyang would make the gesture ahead of an unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit due to take place in coming weeks. CNN, citing an unnamed source, said the groundwork for the move came two months ago when North Korea's foreign minister traveled to Sweden and proposed the idea. Rudy Giuliani, who joined President Donald Trump's legal team last month, told Fox News Channel that North Korea would release the three prisoners on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, had direct knowledge of negotiations around the issue. Trump administration officials have pressed for the Americans' release as a show of goodwill by North Korea before the meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which is expected to take place in late May or early June. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she could not confirm details about the release, but she said Washington was ""cautiously optimistic"" about its ongoing talks with Pyongyang. ""Certainly, that would be an incredible step and certainly a sign of goodwill moving into the summit, moving into these discussions with North Korea. I can't comment any further at this point,"" Sanders said in an interview with Fox News. Asked about Giuliani's comment, a State Department official reiterated on Thursday that the department could not confirm whether the Americans were being released and was working to see them come home as soon as possible. In a Twitter post late on Wednesday, Trump said, ""As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!"" On Wednesday, South Korean media reports quoted a South Korean activist who said North Korea had moved the three Americans from a labor camp to a hotel on the outskirts of Pyongyang. A U.S. official said on Wednesday the U.S. government was looking into the reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity on Wednesday, the official said there was no immediate confirmation of any change in the detainees' status. Even as Washington presses for the release of the three, the parents of a U.S. college student who died last year soon after being release from captivity in North Korea have sued Pyongyang over their son's death, saying Otto Warmbier was ""brutally tortured and murdered."" Details of the location and date of the planned Trump-Kim meeting have not yet been announced, although Trump said on Tuesday that they may be announced soon.

14,2018-05-03,Texas Officials Ignore Dioxin Spread in Houston Waterways,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-harvey-silent-spills-dioxin.html,1697," HIGHLANDS, Texas —  Evelyn and Jerome Matula were still polka-dancing newlyweds in 1950 when they spotted a half-finished cottage in the woods along the San Jacinto River east of Houston. It seemed idyllic, with panoramic views and a sandy path to the river, where their three children and later their grandchildren fished. Now, the retired refinery worker and former educator fear their kin were poisoned by carcinogenic dioxin in the fish and well water. Decades ago, paper mill waste barged down the Houston Ship Channel was buried across the river. From their bluff today, the Matulas can see orange buoys marking a federal Superfund hazardous waste site established in 2008. An agreement announced last month has cleared the way for the San Jacinto Waste Pits to finally be cleaned up. But dioxin damage already has spread far beyond the waste pits, the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press found. More than 30 hotspots — small sites where dioxin has settled — have been located in sediments along the river, the Houston Ship Channel and into Galveston Bay, according to University of Houston research conducted from 2001 to 2011 and pieced together by the news organizations. The affected areas are alongside parks and residential neighborhoods with thousands of homes. But the residents' wells or yards have not been tested by state health officials. Details about the hotspots have not been made public by Texas environmental regulators, who used more than $5 million in federal money to pay for the research. In 2012, they ended a fact-finding committee that oversaw the project and had proposed new standards for dioxin and PCBs that could have been costly to corporate polluters. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality refused to release the full results of the studies that identified the sources of dioxin and PCBs, even to academic researchers, Harris County officials and lawyers who later sued companies over environmental damage. The research funding ended in 2011, leaving unanswered questions about whether toxic damage spread even farther during hurricanes Ike and Harvey. The university data linked hotspots primarily to three sources: the leaking waste pits, the original site of the paper mill in Pasadena and a major chemical complex in nearby Deer Park that is part of another Superfund site, records show. None has been cleaned up. Under the Clean Water Act and state law, Texas authorities were required to address dioxin and PCBs in the river and ship channel, waterways officially designated as ""impaired."" Setting such standards could have forced the responsible companies to clean up and upgrade contaminated stormwater and wastewater treatment. All three TCEQ commissioners, appointed by the governor, declined an interview request. Carl Masterson, a former Houston-Galveston Area Council staffer who for years served as a facilitator for the committee, said state regulators failed to do their duty. Once ""the meetings were done, the project was over and the findings were in, the TCEQ should have approved"" the committee's recommendations, he said. In a statement, the agency said it's still working on ""a document summarizing the source characterization of dioxin loads in the Houston Ship Channel/Upper Galveston Bay system."" The state's approach to dioxin follows the same pattern the Chronicle and AP previously identified in an investigation into air and water pollution releases from Hurricane Harvey. The news organizations found that state and federal regulators did little in response to massive releases of toxic pollution reported during and after Harvey's torrential rains. Similarly, Texas regulators have not followed up on the dioxin research with additional testing to see if wells, parks or property also are contaminated by the pollutants that formed the toxic hotspots. In the Matulas' case, their grandson Sean, a 33-year-old emergency manager, paid to have samples from the cottage's two wells tested after learning he suffers from long-hidden heart and kidney defects that may shorten his life. His mother had moved to the cottage when she was pregnant with him. Recent test results showed that the family well used at the time he was born tested at twice the level of dioxin considered healthy for human consumption. ""I have been told,"" Sean Matula said of conversations with his doctor, ""that I am lucky to be walking."" ___ LEAKING WASTE PITS The Texas Department of Health Services warned in 1990 that catfish and crabs in the San Jacinto and parts of upper Galveston Bay area contained so much dioxin that local seafood posed potential health risks — and banned its consumption by children and pregnant women. The Environmental Protection Agency already had been funding initiatives to clean up the nation's impaired rivers and identify sources of toxic substances in sediments and water that poisoned fish. The actions came in response to revelations in the 1980s that one of the most dangerous dioxin forms had been unleashed into the environment from paper bleaching and chemical manufacturing. Even in microscopic doses, those dioxin types have been linked to birth defects as well as cancer and reproductive problems. Some of the most likely sources were two former paper mills and the huge chemical complex in Deer Park. Then a state park employee discovered sand pits near a highway bridge where pulp from the larger paper mill in Pasadena had been barged in the 1960s, buried and forgotten. A video of the site taken around 2009 shows that fishermen and others had carved a path across unmarked sand pits partially submerged by the river. Particles of what looks like an egg carton were shearing off the shore into the water. Those crystalline fragments are examples of dioxin sediment, said Larry Koenig, who for 10 years was the TCEQ staff member assigned to the dioxin study. He and other experts have estimated that about half the waste originally buried in pits already had escaped into the environment before the site was rediscovered. Koenig retired in 2010, in part, he said, because of frustration over inaction on any proposed water quality standard. A dozen hotspots identified by teams of University of Houston researchers were scattered around those pits. Some of the worst hotspots became part of the San Jacinto Waste Pits Superfund site a decade ago. But others are miles downstream, near riverside neighborhoods in Baytown and LaPorte. Another source of hotspots was chemical plants along Patrick Bayou in Deer Park, according to the committee's reports and research. The bayou had been identified as a priority site for Superfund cleanup even before the state committee's dioxin water quality work began. The committee formed by state regulators to study dioxin included representatives of two companies ultimately found to be major contamination sources: Shell Chemical and OxyVinyls, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical. By 2009, the corporate representatives, along with environmentalists and government officials, had reviewed proposed water quality standards for PCB and dioxin that could have sparked regulatory or legal action against their companies. Most of Patrick Bayou's dioxin and PCB pollution was from historic industrial activities. But Shell and Occidental Chemical would likely have faced pressure to address contaminated runoff, according to TCEQ documents, UH research, EPA records and Hanadi Rifai, the UH environmental engineering professor who oversaw the research teams. Representatives of OxyVinyls and Shell expressed no objections to proposed pollution-reduction reforms in public meetings, according to minutes and interviews. But EPA records show that during the time the dioxin cleanup committee was making its recommendations, neither company had agreed to pay to address polluted Patrick Bayou. EPA subsequently named Shell Chemical, Occidental Chemical and Lubrizol, all chemical companies with operations in Deer Park, as ""potentially responsible parties"", according to EPA records. The companies still have not agreed to fund the cleanup of Patrick Bayou, 16 years after the area was designated as a Superfund site. At the San Jacinto Waste Pits, federal officials said in April that International Paper Company and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation had pledged to pay design costs for the plan to remove 161,000 tons of carcinogenic paper mill waste buried there in the 1960s. Ray Fisher, a Shell spokesman, said the company continues to collaborate ""with other relevant parties"" on the Patrick Bayou site, adding, ""Our focus is on safety of our people and community."" Eric Moses, an Occidental Chemical spokesman, said the company is working with others to complete investigation of the site ""and implement effective controls and remedies that will be protective of human health and the environment."" Both Shell and Occidental Chemical have acted more quickly to address dioxin and other pollutants at multiple Superfund sites in other states, EPA records show. ___ NO KNOWN THREAT? In 2012, the Texas Department of State Health Services delivered its public health assessment of dioxin in the waste pits. The report again warned of hazards posed to fish, but it dismissed the idea of contamination in neighborhoods' soil or well water. Rifai said UH's studies of river water and sediment could not be used to determine whether yards, parks or well water was safe. She is now working with the Galveston Bay Foundation, an independent nonprofit, and Harris County to conduct more testing after Harvey's flooding. The Matulas have two wells on the cottage property. For decades, they drank from the older, shallow well. About 10 years ago, they dug a deeper one. After Sean Matula paid for testing, he asked state health officials to review the complex lab reports. They found dioxin in the older well to be more than twice what the EPA considers dangerous for humans of any age to drink. Dioxin levels in the newer well represented an increased risk of cancer for children and adults but were within EPA's drinking water limits. Houston lawyer Richard Mithoff represents the Matulas and another 600 families. He says he believes he will be able to prove that cancer, birth defects and other ailments reported by many clients who lived around the pits are directly related to the dioxin in the river and its fish. The EPA cleanup of the waste pits won't undo damage done to those who lived there, Mithoff said, ""but it certainly holds great promise for the future and those living there now will be able to rest a little easier."" ___ Frank Bajak of The Associated Press contributed to this report."
15,2018-05-03,Trump Says Campaign Funds Were Not Used to Pay Adult-Film Star,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/us/politics/03reuters-usa-trump-daniels.html,740," WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump said on Thursday his personal lawyer was paid back through a monthly retainer, not campaign funds, for the $130,000 given to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to stop ""false and extortionist accusations"" she made about a sexual encounter with him. Trump, who in April told reporters he did not know about the payment to Daniels made by his lawyer Michael Cohen the month before the 2016 election or the source of the money, said on Twitter the funds were part of a ""private agreement"" that involved money that had ""nothing to do with the campaign."" In his fullest account to date regarding the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, Trump acknowledged the non-disclosure agreement with her to secure her silence about what she has called a one-night sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump also forcefully denied the affair. ""The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair ... despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair,"" Trump wrote, adding that Daniels and her lawyer had violated it. ""Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction,"" Trump added. The claim of repayment is significant because a payment by Cohen could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Trump as candidate would have been permitted to make unlimited personal contributions to his own campaign. Cohen is currently facing a federal criminal investigation in New York in part over the payment to Daniels, with the FBI seizing material from his office and home. The investigation is an offshoot of the ongoing probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump on Thursday said Cohen ""received a monthly retainer"" from which he entered into the ""non-disclosure agreement."" Trump described such agreements as ""very common among celebrities and people of wealth."" Trump's tweets came the morning after former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joined Trump's legal team last month, said Trump had repaid Cohen the hush money given to Daniels. Even if Trump repaid Cohen, the payment to Daniels could still be found to be an undisclosed campaign loan in violation of federal election laws, law professor Kathleen Clark of Washington University in St. Louis said. Clark said Giuliani's statement strongly suggests the payment could have been campaign-related. Omitting the loan from disclosure forms is also arguably a violation of statutes against making false statements to the government, she said. 'HE DID HIS JOB' Giuliani pushed back on that idea on Thursday on the Fox News program ""Fox & Friends,"" saying it was a personal rather than campaign matter to protect the president's family and that Trump did not know the details of the arrangement until about 10 days ago. But Giuliani also appeared to make the opposing argument. ""Imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton ... Cohen made it go away. He did his job,"" said Giuliani, referring to Trump's election opponent. Daniels has filed two lawsuits against Trump, one to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she had signed in October 2016 ahead of the November presidential election in exchange for the $130,000, and another for defamation. The lawsuit over the non-disclosure agreement was put on hold last week by a judge in Los Angeles, who said the potential overlap between the case and the criminal investigation in New York could violate Cohen's constitutional right against self-incrimination. Asked about the president's tweets, Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti told MSNBC Trump opened himself up to another possible defamation suit. ""Our case just got exponentially better,"" Avenatti said. ""This is not about sex ... this is about a cover up."" Daniels offered her account of her relationship with Trump in an interview on the CBS News program ""60 Minutes"" broadcast in March. Avenatti has said that appearance did not violate the agreement because Trump never signed the contract. Separately, Giuliani told the Washington Post that he understood that Cohen's reimbursement from Trump was made in a series of transactions after the 2016 election that were completed in 2017 - during his presidency - but could have continued into this year.

16,2018-05-03,"Teva Reports Jump in First-Quarter Earnings, Raises Guidance",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-teva.html,460," JERUSALEM —  Israeli generic drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries on Thursday said first-quarter earnings surged over 80 percent and raised its outlook for the rest of the year, citing progress in an aggressive restructuring plan. Teva said it posted net income of $1.06 billion, or $1.03 a share, compared to $580 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings came despite a 10 percent drop in sales. ""2018 is off to a solid start,"" Chief Executive Kare Schultz said in a statement. ""Our strong first quarter performance, along with our confidence in executing the restructuring program, gives us a solid foundation to raise our guidance for the year."" Teva, the world's No. 1 generic drugmaker, has been hit hard by price pressure and competition in its core generic business, the loss of patent protection on its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and a more than $30 billion debt load stemming from its acquisition of the generics business of Allergan. The struggling company announced plans in December to cut 14,000 jobs, over one quarter of its global work force. Schultz, who joined Teva last fall, said the restructuring plan is going well. He said the company has already eliminated over 6,000 jobs and managed to reduce its debt load to below the $30 billion mark. He said the company has a ""good balance"" of new generic products hitting the market as older ones come off line. He also said sales of Austedo, a new proprietary drug for movement disorders like Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia, are continuing to grow. A second proprietary drug, the migraine treatment fremanezumab, is expected to hit the U.S. market by the end of the year, after suffering delays due to manufacturing problems, and be introduced in Europe next year. In light of the progress, Teva raised its 2018 revenue outlook to $18.5 to $19 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $18.3 to $18.8 billion. Despite the signs of progress, Teva said its first-quarter sales slumped 10 percent to $5.065 billion from $5.65 billion a year earlier. It cited continued price pressure on its generic business, generic competition to Copaxone and the shedding of some noncore businesses. After opening higher, Teva shares were down 15 cents at $18.45 in late-morning trading on Wall Street. With roots going back more than a century, Teva has grown into a major global player over the past 40 years with a series of acquisitions, and by developing original drugs and leading the move toward cost-saving generic medications. Its successes over the years are a source of pride in Israel. The layoff plans triggered protests at Teva plants in Israel and prompted talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But after talks with the unions, protests have died down."
17,2018-05-03,EU Food Safety Body Tells States to Keep Eye Out for Insecticide After Scare,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-europe-eggs.html,190," BRUSSELS —  The European Union's food safety watchdog urged member states on Thursday to monitor poultry products for the incecticide fipronil following the withdrawal of millions of chicken eggs from supermarket shelves last year. The Parma-based EFSA tested some 5,500 samples of eggs and chicken meat between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30 of last year and found that about one in seven contained levels of fipronil exceeding the legal limit. ""It is recommended that fipronil and other acaricides be included in the future monitoring activities of the member states,"" EFSA said in a report. Eight countries had submitted samples with elevated fipronil concentrations, including Italy, Germany and France, EFSA said. Fipronil is commonly used to treat pets for fleas and ticks but is banned from use in the food chain because it may cause organ damage in humans if large quantities are ingested. After a fipronil scandal broke last summer, Dutch authorities identified the source as a small supplier of cleaning products that had sold them to unwitting producers as a more efficient way to fend off red mites in poultry stables.

18,2018-05-03,"Airbnb Drives Up Rent Costs in Manhattan and Brooklyn, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/nyregion/airbnb-rent-manhattan-brooklyn.html,962," Airbnb’s growing influence caused rents to increase significantly in tourist areas and gentrifying neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where the majority of the company’s rentals are concentrated, according to a report released on Thursday by the city comptroller’s office. In Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea neighborhoods and the Midtown Business District, which accounted for about 11 percent of all Airbnb listings in New York City in 2016, average monthly rents increased by $398 between 2009 and 2016, of which $86, or 21.6 percent, was a result of Airbnb’s presence, the report said. In Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the study said, rents went up 18.6 percent in those years because of Airbnb listings. Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents, the report said. “For years, New Yorkers have felt the burden of rents that go nowhere but up, and Airbnb is one reason why,” the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said in an interview. “It’s just simply supply and demand. Fewer apartments to rent means higher prices, and that’s the Airbnb effect.” The report said that Airbnb’s influence cost New Yorkers $616 million in additional rent in 2016 as a result of price pressures. [Read the report.] Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment listings in New York City, the company’s largest market in the United States. The comptroller’s report shed light on the clash of the so-called sharing economy with city neighborhoods struggling to preserve their stock of affordable housing and rein in skyrocketing rents, though the report also found that the online rental site had a negligible effect on most neighborhoods outside of Manhattan and Brooklyn, where listings are sparse. The study drew on data scraped from Airbnb listings and used regression analysis to compare what rents would have been across 55 neighborhoods if thousands of units had not been listed on the home-sharing website. Still, the report has limitations: An apartment listed on Airbnb does not always translate into a unit lost in the long-term rental market, because apartments may be rented for a short amount of time a year. Airbnb officials said the report confused causation with correlation by blaming the company for higher rents that could have been raised by other factors, like rezoning. However, the comptroller’s study included variables like household income, population, and employment rates. “Comptroller Stringer’s report severely misrepresents the impact of our platform on housing and is full of elementary methodological mistakes,” said Andrew Kalloch, a policy manager at Airbnb. “New Yorkers deserve better from their chief financial officer.” Mr. Stringer said in response, “The methodology is sound.” Mr. Kalloch said Airbnb’s effect on rents was insignificant because listings represent less than 1 percent of apartments in the city. But he acknowledged that some neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of Airbnb rentals. He also said that using 2009 as a starting point distorts the findings because rents in New York tanked during the Great Recession that year. Most New Yorkers, Mr. Kalloch said, use Airbnb as a source of extra income to make ends meet and that entire apartments are rented for a median of 60 nights a year. But Airbnb has long been scrutinized by officials because some landlords use Airbnb to effectively run illegal hotels in residential buildings. And some New York tenants use the platform to rent spare bedrooms to travelers year-round, often in violation of housing rules or without the permission of their landlords. One Airbnb host in Chelsea, a 45-year-old singer and songwriter from California, has rented a room in a two-bedroom apartment for more than three years to tourists who stay an average of four to five nights. The singer spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of being evicted. The singer charges $40 to $110 per night during the summer, which helps cover the $3,050 monthly rent. “It’s a great way to make money,” the singer said. “I get to keep my apartment clean for guests and meet new people in a world where everyone is disconnected.” However, many tenant advocacy groups say that Airbnb increasingly displaces low-income New Yorkers and welcomes unruly neighbors into their buildings. “It really isn’t a good idea to turn our residential housing into illegal hotels so that a $30 billion company can get their I.P.O.,” said Tom Cayler, a member of the West Side Neighborhood Alliance, a coalition of tenants who advocate for the preservation of affordable housing. As in other areas around the world, Airbnb has had a contentious history in New York. In 2014, about three-quarters of all Airbnb rentals in the city were found to be illegal, according to a report released that year by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Under state law, it is illegal in most buildings to rent an apartment for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is present when a guest is renting. But some tenants and landlords skirt the law and rent out entire apartments for shorter amounts of time without being present, the report said. The attorney general’s report said Airbnb was dominated by operators with multiple listings, finding that 6 percent of the hosts made 37 percent of the revenue — or $168 million. The company said it had already expelled thousands of commercial operators from its platform. In 2016, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a bill allowing hosts to be fined up to $7,500 for listing apartments that violate housing regulations. Despite the ongoing feud with New York officials, Mr. Kalloch said his company welcomed certain regulations to rid its platform of abusers. “Along with proactively removing bad actors from our platform,” he said, “Airbnb is supporting legislation in Albany that would provide for rigorous enforcement against illegal hotel operators, among other things.”"
19,2018-05-03,Exxon Pushes Ahead With Rosneft LNG Project Despite Sanctions-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-exxon-rosneft-far-east-lng.html,504," BEIJING/LONDON —  Exxon Mobil is pushing ahead with efforts to develop  its $15 billion (11 billion pound) Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project with Russia's Rosneft despite being forced to exit some joint ventures due to Western sanctions. Two months ago Exxon invited companies including China National Petroleum Corporation's engineering arm to bid for construction contracts by October, sources with knowledge of the matter said. A final investment decision is due in 2019, they said. The project is being jointly developed with Rosneft using gas from the Sakhalin-1 venture which will be chilled into liquid to underpin the LNG plant's initial annual output target of 6 million tonnes. Western sanctions forced Exxon to exit some joint ventures with Rosneft in late February, but LNG is not part of the sanctions. The Russian company said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production-sharing JV struck in the mid-1990s. ""The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetise Sakhalin-1 gas resources,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. ""A liquefied natural gas plant is an option to maximise benefits to the consortium and the Russian state and its citizens,"" she added. Exxon-Rosneft have also held discussions about feeding gas from Sakhalin-1 fields into a planned third production unit at an existing LNG plant run by Gazprom on Sakhalin Island, industry sources said. Rosneft was not available for immediate comment. Exxon's LNG footprint is expanding rapidly with major new projects planned in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and the United States as demand in China and Southeast Asia booms. Gas accounted for 43 percent of Exxon output last year, according to BMO Capital Markets, a share set to rise as new LNG projects start up. CHINESE UP LNG PROJECT WORK CNPC's Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp is preparing to bid for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for Far East LNG's supporting facilities, such as storage tanks, pipelines and utilities, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Chinese engineering companies, banks and shipyards are all muscling into LNG, typically the preserve of Western, Japanese and South Korean players, as government coal-to-gas switching policies make LNG an increasingly strategic fuel. For example, Chinese investment is pouring into African floating LNG projects, import terminals, tankers and traditional land-based plants such as the $12 billion invested in Russia's Yamal facility, used to skirt Western sanctions. Loans in turn drum up business for Chinese engineering firms and shipyards in LNG, and give state-backed companies the upper hand in supply negotiations. It is unclear if Chinese lenders will help finance Far East LNG. The bid deadline for EPC contractors is September 30, sources said. A consortium of Japan's JGC and Texas-headquartered Fluor Corp will handle the core work of project managing and building the liquefaction trains and other key components, industry sources said. JGC was not available for immediate comment and Fluor declined to comment.

21,2018-05-03,Belt-Tightening Demands Put Tunisia’s Democracy at Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/middleeast/tunisia-democracy-economy-reform.html,1583," TUNIS — When Tunisians rose up against their longtime ruler seven years ago, a pair of idealistic young teachers joined in, hoping the protests would usher their North African nation of 10 million into the ranks of the world’s democracies. But today Adel and Marwa Jaafri are struggling financially as the country’s economy sputters, its currency falters and the government imposes fresh belt-tightening measures. Mr. Jaafri, 35, a high school computer science teacher, recently took a second job installing satellite dishes and moonlights fixing computers. “I still can’t afford my life,” he said. “We are just making it, but we have taken out a lot of loans. Everything is more expensive — food, schoolbooks for the children.” Ms. Jaafri, 34, a university professor of computer programming, finished his lament: “Clothes, shoes for the kids. Of course we’re worried. We’re struggling.” Tunisia, often hailed as the sole success story of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is in danger of being crippled by budget-cutting economic policies that critics say are imperiling the country’s democratic experiment. Scholars and economists have warned for years that Tunisia’s economic problems could thwart its political progress. But now a raft of critics are blaming financial measures promoted by international lenders and advisers, and taken up by inexperienced Tunisian politicians, for making them worse and setting off an economic and political crisis. “When you impoverish the poor and middle class you undermine democracy,” said Jihen Chandoul, an economist and co-founder of the Tunisian Observatory of Economy, a research institute. “What’s hurting the democratic process are austerity measures we’ve been asked to implement to access loans. Tunisian democracy is in danger.” It is a pattern that has played out around the world, in Latin America, Asia and recently Greece, as the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders demand that governments balance their budgets and open their economies. Those policies often produce jarring hardship and political upheaval that can undermine support for the very kind of democratic and capitalist systems the West is trying to build. In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began, those measures are doubly biting for a people who had harbored such great hopes for a fairer society in one of the Arab world’s few democracies. Protests against higher taxes and rising prices broke out across the country in January after new economic policies advocated by the I.M.F. and Tunisia’s Western sponsors took effect. Following their guidance, Tunisia slashed the budget deficit at the expense of popular demands for jobs, adopted free trade policies that may hurt Tunisian producers and allowed a devaluation of the currency that has raised food and fuel prices. Tunisian economists, activists, and politicians cited a dozen more examples of what they described as free-market-style economic prescriptions that have worsened people’s lives and damaged faith in the nascent democracy. One test of that faith may come Sunday, when Tunisians head to the polls for the first municipal elections since the 2010 uprising. Tunisia is in poor economic shape. Its gross domestic product is growing at a tepid 2 percent, while unemployment remains at 15.5 percent, and about 30 percent among the young, many of whom while away their days smoking water pipes at cafes with little hope of being able to move out of their parents’ homes. The Tunisian dinar has fallen about 40 percent compared to the euro and the dollar since 2011, increasing prices for fuel and almost all consumer goods. International ratings agencies have repeatedly lowered Tunisia’s creditworthiness, straining the government’s ability to borrow to invest in jobs or public works programs. According to a poll conducted late last year by the International Republican Institute, a Washington democracy advocacy organization, 83 percent of Tunisians say the country is going in the wrong direction, with 64 percent citing the economy or unemployment as their biggest worry. Tunisian political leaders say they had few options but to submit to demands by international lenders, including the European Union and the I.M.F., to whom they owed $31 billion, equivalent to 60 percent of the G.D.P. “We have no choice,” Naoufel Jammali, a lawmaker of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda Party and a former cabinet minister. “We have to strengthen our ties with the international institutions which advise us to take these steps. Everyone keeps talking about a new economic model, but we have no idea how to create a new model.” Politicians attribute the economic hardships to the lingering aftereffects of the global financial meltdown a decade ago as well as troubles in neighboring Libya, an oil-rich behemoth that once provided jobs, businesses and remittances but that is now a source of security threats, including terrorist attacks that have damaged Tunisia’s tourism industry. They also blame political infighting in Parliament and the street protests, factors that would have been easier to suppress under the dictatorship. In February, Parliament exploded into shouting matches over the process for naming a new central bank governor. “Before there was always one strong boss to make decisions,” said Mohamed Saidane, a lawmaker and member of the secular Nidaa Tounes party. “Now, we’re changing. There are 270 deputies and 25 parties and no one has a majority. The electoral system is slowing down the economy.” But others pinpoint specific decisions made by the country’s leaders at the behest of the monetary fund and other Western powers that have worsened Tunisia’s problems. Last year the I.M.F. delayed a loan disbursement because it said the government wasn’t moving fast enough to sell off three banks and slash government jobs. It also coaxed Tunisia into adopting higher sales tax rates in an effort to reduce the 2018 budget deficit. Tunisians were stunned when the fund’s Tunisia mission chief, Bjorn Rother, told Bloomberg last month that the dinar should fall even lower, a sentiment that baffled economists who worry that consumers are already suffering under soaring fuel and food costs and that the government is squeezed by debt payments denominated in dollars and euros. A Tunisian business website marveled, “Does Bjorn Rother want to kill the Tunisian economy?” The monetary fund, which was roundly criticized in the 1980s and 1990s for imposing painful structural adjustments on developing countries, insists that it is not promoting austerity in Tunisia. “We advocate well designed, well implemented, socially balanced reforms,” the fund’s spokesman, Gerry Rice, said. “Jobs and fairness will come with economic growth.” In a question-and-answer page posted on the organization’s website in response to the criticism, the I.M.F. said the government could reduce debt without hurting the poor, for example by reducing subsidies on products consumed mostly by the affluent and strengthening tax collection, and channeling those resources to job creation and social spending. Allowing Tunisia’s currency to fall, the fund’s defenders say, will jump-start Tunisian industries such as textiles, which are now challenged by imports from China and Turkey. But the monetary fund says it is ultimately the government that calls the shots on the country’s economic direction. This year, the European Parliament dealt a further blow to Tunisia’s investment prospects, listing the country as a haven for money laundering and tax-dodging, a move considered unfair even by some Western politicians. “I can’t understand how you can put Tunisia in the same basket” as Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen, said Marie-Christine Vergiat, a French member of the European Parliament. Some politicians suggested the blacklisting was meant to press Tunisia into signing a controversial free trade agreement with Europe that Tunisians worry would further damage prospects for embattled local producers.“They’re using their weight in the E.U. to increase economic integration,” said Mr. Jammali, the lawmaker. “But it’s really a David-and-Goliath situation. We are negotiating with a huge power.” Economic strains on ordinary Tunisians can be seen at any secondhand clothing market in Tunis, the capital. The sprawling flea markets known as “fripes” used to draw the poor and the young, as well as a smattering of vintage clothing aficionados. Now middle-aged and middle-class families depend on them, and complain that even there prices have jumped. A jacket that used to cost the equivalent of $3 now costs more than $8. During a recent visit, buyers and sellers recalled that life was easier, costs lower and profit margins higher under the deposed strongman, Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali. “We no longer buy new things, and even the fripe has gotten more expensive,” said Tawfiq Jendoubi, a 29-year-old employee at a grocery store. “I’m realizing now that everything here is too expensive. I cannot afford any of it.” The Jaafri family struggles to get by on a combined income of about $15,000 a year. After paying rent, school fees and debts, the family of five is left with about $13 a day for food, transportation, clothes and any extras. “We’re not able to save anything,” Ms. Jaafri said. In the country where the Arab Spring began, many Tunisians voice longing for a strong leader who can quickly make decisions and put the squabbling political class in its place. Human rights advocates have voiced alarm over what they see as the country’s authoritarian drift, manifested in prosecutions of politicians, journalists and activists who criticize the police and army. The protests in January were met with mass arrests. Analysts say they worry that the country is edging toward a model of autocracy similar to Egypt’s after a 2013 coup by the former military leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. “We’re moving close to that, very slowly,” said Fadil Aliriza, a Tunis-based analyst and journalist. “Whether we’re going to have some kind of violent rupture remains to be seen.”"
22,2018-05-03,"Trump Tweet Wasn&#8217;t a Threat to World Cup Bid, Says U.S. Soccer Chief",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/sports/soccer/03reuters-soccer-fifa-wcup-trump.html,484," COPENHAGEN —  The joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup has not been damaged by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent controversial tweet of support, bid co-chair Carlos Cordeiro told Reuters on Thursday. The U.S is bidding together with Canada and Mexico to host an expanded 48 team World Cup in 2026 but faces opposition from Morocco who have large support from African nations, as well as Russia and France. The 211 football associations who make up FIFA’s membership will vote on the hosting rights in June. Last week Trump said in a tweet: ""It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?"" FIFA responded by issuing a reminder of the ethics and code of conduct rules for bidding campaigns. Cordeiro said the tweet represented a welcome expression of support for the joint bid. ""I don’t see it as threatening. I think you have got to appreciate how he says things. I think what was implicit in what he said was that he would like to see people support our bid and that is what I like my head of state to say,"" Cordeiro, who is the president of the U.S. soccer federation, said. Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both subsequently tweeted their own backing for the 2026 bid and Cordeiro said that showed the campaign had full political backing. “Mexico and Canada tweeted on the same day and no-one talks about their tweets. But the reality is that all three heads of states have been very vocal in support of our united bid. I think that is fantastic,” he said. U.S soccer officials have been meeting regularly with the Trump administration, including the President's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, a source close to the bid told Reuters. The source added that one of those meetings was just two days before Trump issued the tweet but said that the intervention on social media had not been discussed. Cordeiro, who was in Denmark to meet with Nordic soccer officials before leaving for further bid promotion events in Dubai, said he had not encountered any negative feedback from Trump's tweet. ""It doesn’t damage us,"" he said. ""We have had extensive conversations with the White House going back months, as have Canada and Mexico (with their governments). Why? Because FIFA require a number of assurances, warranties and guarantees on behalf of each of our governments in terms of access, taxes, work-permits, security, airport facilities – these are all part and parcel of submitting a bid which we did in March. ""You do that with the cooperation of your government – we have had a lot of contact with them, including meetings last week,"" he said. (Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"

""The Vice President is delaying his trip to Brazil in order to ensure all diplomatic and national security resources are available as President Trump plans for his historic talks with the Kim regime,"" said Alyssa Farah, Pence's spokeswoman. No exact date or location has been announced for Trump’s meeting with Kim but it is expected to take place in late May or early June. Pence did not want divert any attention from the  talks, Farah said. Pence’s trip had been expected to include a stop in Manaus, a city near the border with Venezuela. The Trump administration has been critical of Venezuela's government and has been weighing new sanctions against it. Pence had also been scheduled to visit Rio de Janeiro on May 30 and meet with Brazilian President Michel Temer and cabinet ministers in Brasilia on May 31, a Brazilian government source told Reuters last month. ""The vice president looks forward to traveling to Brazil in the near future and will continue to work closely with U.S. allies in Latin America to further strengthen our important alliances in the region,"" Farah said.

24,2018-05-03,"U.S. Factory Orders Rise, but Business Equipment Spending Slowing",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-usa-economy-factory.html,408," By Lucia Mutikani May 3 - New orders for U.S.-made goods rose more than expected in March, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment and a range of other products, but there are signs that business spending on equipment is slowing. Factory goods orders rose 1.6 percent, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for February was revised up to show orders jumping 1.6 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent increase. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 1.4 percent in March. Orders rose 7.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in March. Orders for transportation equipment increased 7.6 percent, lifted by a 44.5 percent jump in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. Transportation orders rose 8.9 percent in February. Orders for machinery fell 1.9 percent, the largest drop since April 2016, after rising 0.6 percent in February. Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery surged 2.6 percent. Orders for motor vehicles fell 1.0 percent, the biggest drop since last July. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6 percent while bookings for computers advanced 1.0 percent. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by strong domestic and global demand. But a shortage of skilled workers and rising commodity prices after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are starting to impact production. A survey on Monday showed sentiment among manufacturers falling in April for a second straight month amid growing concerns about the tariffs, which were imposed by President Donald Trump in March. Manufacturers said the import duties had increased prices, made it difficult to source material and brought business planning to a standstill. That could undercut business spending on equipment. Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries. The Commerce Department revised March orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, to show them falling 0.4 percent instead of dipping 0.1 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 1.0 percent in February. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.8 percent in March instead of the 0.7 percent drop reported last month. Core capital goods shipments were up 1.2 percent in February."
25,2018-05-03,"As Ridership Surges, Ferries to Get $300 Million to Expand Service",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-ferry-nyc.html,778," Admitting that his administration vastly underestimated the appeal of heavily subsidized boat rides, Mayor Bill de Blasio is doubling down on his big investment in a commuter ferry service for New York City. Standing on a dock in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on Thursday morning, Mr. de Blasio said he would commit an additional $300 million to expand the service and double the capacity of its fleet. City officials now project that NYC Ferry will attract as many as nine million riders annually, twice their initial forecast. “New Yorkers have spoken,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re going to need bigger boats.” Some of those regular riders have abandoned the overcrowded, problem-plagued subway system, which carries nearly six million riders per day. Others include new residents of thriving waterfront neighborhoods that are poorly served by traditional modes of mass transit, city officials said. Justin Brannan, a councilman from Brooklyn, praised the ferry service as a better option. “This is Bay Ridge, there’s two ways out: the R train and the Gowanus, and neither of them are pretty,” Mr. Brannan said, alluding to the traffic-clogged Gowanus Expressway. Among the changes city officials announced were the ordering of more large boats, the expansion of some of the busier docks and a rush-hour express run between the Rockaways and Lower Manhattan that would provide a nonstop cruise from one of the farthest reaches of the city to the financial district for the cost of a subway ride. Setting the ferry fare to match the $2.75 subway fare was an innovation of Mr. de Blasio’s administration. Before he took office, the city was subsidizing a limited ferry service on the East River that charged as much as $6 per ride. City officials estimate that the subsidy for NYC Ferry amounts to $6.60 per passenger. But Mr. de Blasio wanted to present the ferry service as an alternative to the subway. He committed about $390 million to build docks in waterfront neighborhoods that were poorly served by the city’s public transit system and to hire a company to build and operate a fleet of boats. The city launched the service a year ago and quickly found that it had underestimated demand. Last summer, the city had to scramble to charter boats larger than its fleet of 149-passenger vessels. City officials, who had argued against the need for bigger boats, relented and revised their order to include boats that can hold 350 passengers. Three of those larger boats are scheduled to arrive from a shipyard in Louisiana over the summer and three more are expected next year. In the meantime, Hornblower, the company that operates the ferries, will charter as many as eight boats that can carry up to 500 passengers each, said James Patchett, chief executive of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Patchett said the chartered vessels would allow the city to narrow the gap between boats to 20 to 25 minutes on all four of its routes, down from 25 to 60 minutes last summer. But Mr. Patchett warned that he could not promise that demand would never again exceed the capacity of the ferries. “On a really crazy-beautiful day in the summer, when it seems like everyone in the city wants to go to the beach at the exact same time, there are still going to be lines,” he said. The service is scheduled to add two routes this summer, one starting in the Soundview section of the Bronx and the other on the Lower East Side. After those routes are established, city officials will decide where the ferries might go next, Mr. de Blasio said. “There’s a lot of places that would like ferry service,” he said. Mr. de Blasio disputed the idea that the investment in the ferry service would be better spent improving the subways and buses, which serve far more riders and some of the city’s lowest-income neighborhoods. He reiterated his view that the best solution for the subways would be a steady source of increased funding, such as an additional tax on the city’s wealthiest residents. “The answer is a long-term funding source that would allow us to fix the whole God-forsaken thing,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that he believed a different balance of power in the state Legislature this fall could provide sufficient support for a so-called millionaire’s tax. Standing on the dock in the sunshine, Mr. de Blasio refused to let the steady tide of questions from skeptical reporters erode his enthusiasm for the ferry service he deemed a resounding success. “We’ve got to do more than one thing to create a 21st-century city with multiple mass transit options for people,” the mayor said."
26,2018-05-03,Glencore's Congo Mining Conundrum,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-congo-glencore-mining.html,933," LONDON/DAKAR —  Miner and commodities trader Glencore is embroiled in a legal tangle over its copper and cobalt operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, where conflict and changes to regulations have deterred many mining firms. U.S. sanctions on Glencore's former Israeli partner in Congo have been a trigger for litigation. At the same time, relations with the Congolese authorities are under strain from a dispute with the government over a new mining code. Investors are watching closely, particularly for any impact on supplies of cobalt from Congo, which is by far the world's biggest producer of the metal whose uses include making alloys for jet engines and batteries for electric cars and mobile phones. Glencore accounts for more than a quarter of the world's cobalt output, most of it from Congo, which itself is the source of 60 percent of global supplies. Any disruption could push up cobalt prices from already historic highs of $90,000 (66,383 pounds) a tonne. <CBD3> ""The price would absolutely go through the roof,"" Bernstein analyst Paul Gait said. The copper price could also be affected by any disruption at Congolese mines but any impact is likely to be less dramatic as Congo is only the world's fifth biggest producer, analysts say. WHAT IS THE ROW ABOUT? Glencore's legal row revolves around its former partnership with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire accused by Washington of using his friendship with Congolese President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals. Gertler denies any wrongdoing. Glencore has said the U.S. sanctions that were imposed in December mean it can no longer pay Gertler royalty payments. A company affiliated with Gertler has challenged this in court. In addition, Glencore's relations with its former business partner, state mining firm La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (Gecamines), have been strained over the new mining code that raises taxes and royalty payments. Gecamines Chairman Albert Yuma has championed the new code, while Glencore and other foreign miners oppose the changes and have presented proposals to soften the new demands. The government has until now rejected these. Glencore told its shareholders this week talks were continuing and a compromise could be reached. WHAT IS THE LATEST LEGAL SITUATION? Gecamines said on April 24 it had begun legal proceedings to wind up Kamoto Copper Company (KCC), one of Congo's biggest copper and cobalt mines that is a venture between Gecamines and Glencore's Katanga Mining. Gecamines said debts owed by KCC to Glencore and its subsidiaries at the end of 2017 topped $9 billion, and said the commodities group charged the venture interest rates on loans that were too high. Glencore denies this. Glencore said on April 22 Katanga was assessing options to deal with KCC's ""capital deficiency"", which could include  converting some debt to equity or forgiving a portion of debt. Glencore Chairman Tony Hayward said on May 2 a recapitalisation of KCC could be successfully concluded. On April 27, Glencore said its Congolese mining subsidiaries had been served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion by Ventora Development Sasu, a company affiliated with Gertler. Ventora is seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Glencore's unit Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from KCC. Glencore, which disputes the amounts, said Mutanda Mining and KCC would contest the freezing order and any subsequent proceedings. Glencore on May 1 won a temporary injunction against Gertler over the alleged unpaid royalties. Further hearings are expected in London on May 11 and in Congo on May 8. HOW DID THE ROYALTIES ISSUE ARISE? In February 2017, Glencore paid Gertler's Fleurette Group nearly $1 billion to boost its stake in the Mutanda and KCC copper and cobalt mines. Under the deal, Glencore pledged to pay royalties at a rate of 2.5 percent to Gertler's companies, which had bought the rights from Gecamines. These payments ceased after U.S. sanctions were imposed. Glencore owns 100 percent of Mutanda Mining and about 86 percent of Katanga Mining, which in turn has a 75 percent stake in KCC. HOW WILL GLENCORE SHARES REACT? Analysts and credit agencies say Congo risk is already factored into their view of Glencore, a diversified mining firm that has many operations around the world feeding into profits. RBC Capital Markets revised down its assessment of Glencore modestly on April 30, from ""top pick"" to ""outperform"", saying even now the company's shares were undervalued.    It said any reduction in copper output could tip the world market into deficit this year, pushing up prices and helping Glencore's overall copper business. But Glencore's earnings could be hurt by a disruption to cobalt production in Congo. The company's cobalt output outside Africa in 2017 was just 3,500 tonnes compared with 23,900 tonnes from Congo and Zambia combined. CAN GLENCORE RESOLVE THE LEGAL ROW? Glencore has operated for years in Congo and places around the world that other companies deem too risky, so many analysts say its experience and size will help it resolve the issues. But Congo has seized assets held by Western firms in the past. In 2010, Congo seized the licence for the Kolwezi copper-cobalt project from First Quantum. The Canadian firm secured an agreement to resolve the issue in 2012 following international arbitration. Elisabeth Caesens, director of Brussels-based Resource Matters, a group advocating better global resource management, said Glencore's size might not be enough to protect it. ""Congolese authorities have cancelled fully operational projects in the past in less troubling circumstances,"" she said.

27,2018-05-03,UK's Brent Oilfields Halt Output Due to Terminal Closure,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-northsea-oil-brent.html,317," LONDON —  North Sea oilfields connected to the Brent oil pipeline have stopped production due to a shutdown at the UK's Sullom Voe oil terminal, the Brent pipeline operator said, reducing output of the crude which helps underpin a global pricing benchmark. The Brent stream is scheduled to load almost 100,000 barrels per day of crude in May and is usually the smallest of five crude grades that underpin the Brent benchmark, which is used to set prices worldwide. ""As a result of a shutdown at Sullom Voe Terminal, production has ceased from all Brent System and Ninian pipeline entrants, which includes all TAQA northern North Sea assets,"" oil company TAQA, which operates the Brent pipeline, said in an email. The terminal was expected to reopen on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter said. It was not possible to confirm the exact amount of production affected. The incident follows unplanned outages of another crude grade underpinning the Brent benchmark, Forties, earlier this year and in 2017. The outage of Forties, much larger than Brent, helped boost world prices. Brent is almost a quarter the size of the 400,000 bpd Forties system. Sullom Voe terminal is operated by Enquest. A company spokesperson said it spotted a fault on Tuesday. ""During a routine visual inspection of the process pipework within the Sullom Voe Terminal, a minor defect was identified requiring immediate remedial work, which is underway,"" Enquest said. ""With safety as our top priority, we carried out a controlled shutdown of the incoming Brent and Ninian pipeline systems. There is no risk to people and no impact to the environment. We have advised Terminal users and will keep them regularly updated with progress."" Oil trading sources said earlier that one 600,000-barrel Brent cargo due to load in May has been dropped from the loading schedule and another was delayed into June.

28,2018-05-03,The Latest: Missouri to Hold Special Session on Greitens,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-missouri-governor-the-latest.html,713," JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. —  The Latest on the investigation of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (all times local): 7:58 p.m. The Missouri Legislature has called itself into a special session to consider impeaching Gov. Eric Greitens following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of charity resources. House and Senate leaders announced Thursday night that they had gathered petition signatures from more than three-fourths of all lawmakers in each chamber, which is the threshold required in the state constitution. The special session will start at 6:30 p.m. May 18 — just 30 minutes after the regular session ends. It will mark the first time in Missouri history that a Legislature has called itself into a special session. It comes as Greitens is facing two felony charges — one related to a 2015 extramarital affair and the other to using a charity donor list for his political campaign. ___ 6:45 p.m. The Missouri House has enough signatures to call a special session that could impeach Republican Gov. Eric Greitens. House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty told the Kansas City Star Thursday that 138 members had signed petition, more than the three-fourths threshold needed in the 165-seat chamber. Three-fourths of the Senate would also need to agree to a special session. More than one-third of senators from both parties have already called on the governor to resign in the wake of two felony charges. A spokeswoman for the Senate president pro tem confirmed that the Senate has the petition and is collecting signatures. Greitens faces his first criminal trial May 14 related to an invasion of privacy charge stemming from an extramarital affair he had before he took office. A House report released Wednesday also presented evidence that the governor filed false information with the Missouri Ethics Commission. ___ 4 p.m. The publisher of a political publication says he paid his own money to buy audiotapes made by the ex-husband of a woman who had an affair with Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens and that he intended to use them to write a book. Missouri Times publisher Scott Faughn, in a column Thursday, says he bought the recordings from Al Watkins, attorney for the ex-husband who secretly recorded his wife discussing the affair. Greitens goes to trial May 14 on an invasion of privacy charge stemming from the affair. Watkins told reporters last week he received two anonymous $50,000 payments in January and deduced they were to pay the ex-husband's legal fees. Watkins declined comment Thursday. Faughn did not immediately respond to questions about whether he provided $50,000 or the entire $100,000. ___ 11 a.m. Video cameras will not be allowed in the courtroom when Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens goes to trial later this month in St. Louis. Circuit Judge Rex Burlison on Thursday turned down a request from a lawyer working on behalf of several media outlets. But Burlison says he will consider allowing audio and still photos. Among other things, Burlison cited security concerns and the fact that the woman involved in the affair opposes video cameras in the courtroom. Greitens faces trial starting May 14 on an invasion of privacy charge stemming from an extramarital affair in 2015, before he was elected. He's accused of taking a partially nude and unauthorized photo of the woman while she was bound and blindfolded in the basement of his home. Mark Sableman, the attorney for the media organizations that include The Associated Press, says he is disappointed in the ruling, calling video an ""anti-spin antidote."" ___ 9:30 a.m. The Missouri House has spent at least $15,000 on court reporters to transcribe its work as it investigates allegations against Gov. Eric Greitens. Records provided to The Associated Press under the state Sunshine Law cover the first month of work by a special investigatory committee, from early March to early April. In addition to hiring court reporters, the records show the House had paid $240 to serve subpoenas to several witnesses. The House committee has continued to work since then. The panel released a report Wednesday indicating that Greitens used a donor list from a veterans' charity for his political campaign and then filed an Ethics Commission document falsely attributing its source to a campaign aide. It also released a report last month related to alleged sexual misconduct by Greitens."
29,2018-05-03,Robots Help Artist Bring Fine Bison Hair to Pricey Paintings,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/technology/03reuters-technology-robot-art.html,250," NEW YORK —  American artist Barnaby Furnas has turned to a custom-made robot to help him with paintings that can sell for more than $100,000 at New York galleries. Furnas and several artists are using digital printing robots that use techniques in paintings that were previously impossible or too labor intensive. The machines are guided by inputs from artists and optical sensors to paint in fine detail in lines thinner than a human eyelash. ""I literally think of that robot as a friend,"" Furnas said in an interview. ""More than a pet, less than an art assistant - somewhere in there."" He has used a robot called ""sozo,"" which means imagination in Japanese, for tasks such as painting thousands of hairs on a bison in one of his artworks. It leaves marks on a canvas according to his instructions that he communicates through an optical tracking system attached to a paintbrush-like rod. It records a painter's movements, allowing artists to edit brushstrokes before putting an image on a canvas. Those digital images can be combined with brushwork from an artist to bring new dimensions to a painting. Sozo was created by technology startup Artmatr, whose CEO Ben Tritt is a painter. He sees the company as an open-source community that will help artists merge digital technology with traditional painting methods. Besides Sozo, Artmatr also has a variety of machines that use ink jet heads found in printers. ""It lowers the risk threshold for individual mark making,"" Furnas said. (Jon Herskovitz)"
30,2018-05-03,Missouri to Hold Session to Consider Impeaching Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-missouri-governor.html,652," JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. —  In a historic move, Missouri lawmakers announced Thursday that they are calling themselves into a special session later this month to consider impeaching Gov. Eric Greitens following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of charity resources for his political campaign. Republican House and Senate leaders said they had gathered more than the constitutionally required signatures of three-fourths of the members of each chamber to summon themselves into a special session that will start at 6:30 p.m. on May 18 — just 30 minutes after the end of work in their regular session. It will mark the first time in Missouri history that lawmakers have called a special session. Extraordinary sessions typically are called by governors. ""This was not a decision made lightly and certainly not without great deliberation and effort,"" Missouri House Speaker Todd Richardson said. He pledged a ""fair process that will not be rushed to conclusion."" Various spokespeople for Greitens did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday night. The petition calls upon lawmakers to consider the upcoming recommendations of the House investigatory committee on potential ""disciplinary actions"" against the first-term Republican governor, which also could include lesser reprimands than impeachment. The special session petition was signed by 138 of the current 161 House members and 29 of the current 33 senators, Richardson said. Convening a special session will allow the investigatory committee to continue its work without worrying that it could be arbitrarily halted by the end of the regular session. According to the Missouri Constitution, the special session can last no more than 30 days. If the House votes to impeach Greitens, which requires 82 votes, the Senate then would appoint a panel of seven judges to conduct a trial on whether to remove him from office. Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard said he already has had conversations with retired judges about the process for putting together a trial panel. ""We stand ready to do it if called upon,"" he said. All of Missouri's top Republican and Democratic legislative leaders already had called on Greitens to resign, which he has declined to do. ""Pursuing impeachment against a Missouri governor is history none of us wants to make, but Eric Greitens' actions have made it unavoidable,"" said House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty. A spokeswoman for Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft confirmed the special session petition had been filed with the office Thursday night. Only one other Missouri official — former Democratic Secretary of State Judi Moriarty in 1994 — has been removed from office following impeachment. The legislative announcement about a special session came a day after a House investigatory committee released a report indicating that Greitens had misused a donor list from a veterans' charity he founded to raise money for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The report included testimony from a former Greitens' aide indicating the campaign also falsely identified the source of the donor list in a settlement with the Missouri Ethics Commission. It was the second stunning report from the House panel. Last month, it released a report with testimony from a woman alleging that Greitens had restrained, slapped, shoved, threatened and belittled her during a series of sexual encounters in 2015 that at times left her crying and afraid. Greitens faces a May 14 trial in St. Louis on a felony invasion of privacy indictment stemming from his encounter with the woman. He is accused of taking and transmitting a partially nude and unauthorized photo of the woman while she was bound and blindfolded in the basement of his home. Greitens has acknowledged having a consensual affair but has denied criminal wrongdoing. He also was charged April 20 in St. Louis with a felony charge of tampering with computer data for allegedly disclosing The Mission Continues donor list to a political fundraiser in 2015 without the permission of the St. Louis-based veterans' charity that he had founded."
31,2018-05-03,Correction: Zodiac Killer-DNA Story,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-zodiac-killer-dna.html,741," SAN FRANCISCO —  In a story May 3 about the Zodiac Killer investigation, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the killer was dubbed Zodiac because of astrological symbols he included in letters sent to police and media. The killer referred to himself as Zodiac in the letters. A corrected version of the story is below: DNA match sought to Zodiac Killer after break in other case California detectives want to use DNA tracing technology to try to zero in on the infamous Zodiac Killer after investigators used the method to arrest a suspect in another old serial killing case SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Northern California detectives still trying to identify the infamous Zodiac Killer who targeted victims in the late 1960s and taunted investigators with letters say they hope to try the same DNA tracing technology recently used to arrest a suspect in another string of cold-case serial slayings — those blamed on the Golden State Killer. But first they have to get a better DNA profile. Several months ago, the Vallejo Police Department sent two letters written by the Zodiac Killer to a private lab in hopes of finding his DNA on the back of the stamps or envelope flaps that may have been licked. They are expecting results soon. ""They were confident they would be able to get something off it,"" Vallejo police Detective Terry Poyser told the Sacramento Bee. Poyser said he hopes a full DNA profile will be found that will enable detectives to try the same DNA sleuthing techniques that were used to arrest Joseph DeAngelo last month. Authorities suspect he committed at least 12 murders and 50 rapes in California between 1976 and 1986. Investigators uploaded DNA collected at one of the crime scenes to an open-source genealogical website and found a partial match to a distant relative of DeAngelo's. From there, they painstakingly constructed a family tree dating back several generations before they zeroed in on DeAngelo. Some privacy advocates say they are concerned with the process and worry about future abuses, but detectives investigating the Zodiac Killer say they hope the technique will help solve one of the most vexing cold cases in the country. ""That's a great idea,"" said Gary Harmor, founder and director of the Serological Research Institute, a private DNA lab. ""I think we'll see more investigations use this technique."" Detectives in Southern California are testing DNA collected from a double-murder and rape to see if they can be tied to DeAngelo. Another man, Craig Coley, was recently cleared of those crimes after spending 38 years in prison in the murder of a 24-year-old college student and her 4-year-old son in 1978. The Zodiac Killer fatally stabbed or shot to death five people in Northern California in 1968 and 1969, then sent taunting letters and cryptograms to the police and newspapers. The Vallejo police are the lead investigators because the first two victims were killed there. The killer referred to himself as Zodiac in some of the letters. Various pieces of evidence, including a rope used to tie a victim as well as the letters, have been tested unsuccessfully for the killer's DNA profile. Poyser said recent advances in DNA testing prompted investigators to seek a match on two of the killer's letters. Vallejo Mayor Bob Sampayan said the samples were sent to the lab as a matter of routine. Sampayan, a former homicide detective, said police submit samples every couple of years in hopes that advances in DNA testing will finally yield a profile detectives can use. ""It was coincidental,"" Sampayan said of the new DNA test occurring at the same time as the breakthrough in the Golden State Killer case. ""There will come a time when we get a match,"" he said. The 2007 movie ""Zodiac,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., renewed widespread interest in a case that has always had a cult following of amateur detectives and cryptographers who sought to crack the killer's code. One of those amateur sleuths, Tom Voigt, said the key to solving the Zodiac killings is mimicking the Golden State Killer investigation, which included forming a full-time task force dedicated to the case and exploiting publicly accessible DNA databases. Voigt said the Zodiac case was being investigated part time by a Police Department in a city that filed for municipal bankruptcy. ""There's a formula to follow,"" Voigt said. ""And it's to simply copy what happened to the Golden State Killer."""
32,2018-05-03,China Customs Expands Checks on U.S. Fruit Imports-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-usa-trade-china-fruits.html,708," BEIJING/CHICAGO —  China's major ports of entry have ramped up checks on fresh fruit imports from the United States, five Chinese industry sources said, which could delay shipments from U.S. growers already dealing with higher tariffs as Sino-U.S. trade ties worsen. Fruits were among 128 U.S. goods that China slapped with more expensive import tariffs in retaliation for U.S. levies on Chinese steel and aluminium as trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies flared this year. A U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Beijing for talks with Chinese officials. The two sides are expected to discuss an array of U.S. complaints about China's trade practices, from accusations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development. Since last week, Beijing has dispatched quarantine experts to major ports including Shanghai and Shenzhen to make more thorough on-site checks for disease and rot, a source based in Shanghai with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""China has resumed the practise of inspecting every batch of U.S. fresh fruit,"" the source said, adding that inspectors had previously checked only around 30 percent of shipments. China had dialled back the checks in November 2017. Since Monday, all U.S.-originated fruit shipments have been subject to up to seven days of quarantine check on arrival in Shenzhen, said an industry source based at the port in China's south. Previously, customs officers in China had let shipments through while they conducted sample checks. Several containers of oranges imported by the source's company from the United States have been intercepted this week, the Shenzhen industry source added. China's customs office could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours. Several batches of U.S apples have failed quarantine inspections and will be returned to the United States, the Shanghai source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Washington-based Chelan Fresh sales manager Bryan Peebles said he had heard of some shipment holdups, but that his export business, which includes apples and cherries, was not affected in recent weeks. ""There has been news of detaining of fruits – citrus and a little bit of apples,"" he said, adding that exporters will get a better handle on any heightened scrutiny when the year's first California cherry exports arrive in China this week. The United States sold $18 million (£13.2 million) of fresh apples to China in 2017 out of $872 million in total exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The more thorough inspections came as the cherry season on the U.S. West Coast kicked off. Shipments from Washington state typically begin in June. ""We're crossing our fingers and toes that everything will get worked out in the next month. China's a big market for us,"" said Randy Eckert, export sales manager for Washington-based Yakima Fresh LLC. If the measures remain in place, he fears a ""domino effect"" of cancelled orders by China and a rush by U.S. cherry growers to resell the perishable produce domestically or to other importers such as Canada. Likely days-long delays during the height of cherry shipping season this summer will raise the risk of spoilage at ports of entry, said Keith Hu, director of international operations for the industry group Northwest Cherry Growers. ""During the peak of our season, there is no way that they will have enough refrigerated storage for our cherries. The chances that our cherries will be destroyed under the sun is far greater,"" he said. ""We're looking at alternative markets."" China is the third-largest export market for fresh cherries from the United States. U.S. exporters shipped $119 million of fresh cherries to China, just under a third of total shipments worth $605 million in 2017. Fruits have previously been a casualty of bilateral trade spats. Several years ago, China banned some imports of Philippine fruits as bilateral ties deteriorated over a maritime territorial dispute in the South China Sea. One Chinese online retailer that imports and sells U.S. cherries has suspended plans to promote U.S. fruits, a source at the company said.

33,2018-05-03,Boardroom Showdown Could Alter Telecom Italia's Future,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-telecomitalia-elliott.html,935," MILAN/LONDON —  Warring investors will take their battle for boardroom control of Telecom Italia to a shareholder vote on Friday, with both sides promising major changes to reshape Italy's slumbering telecoms heavyweight. Hedge fund Elliott is leading a campaign to end top shareholder Vivendi's grip over Telecom Italia (TIM), blaming the French media group for TIM's faltering share price and serving its own interests. It is proposing an independent board, asset sales and a return of dividends. Vivendi accuses Elliott of proposing ""quick fixes"" and wants investors to back TIM's strategy, unveiled in March, including major investment in digital content, an internal modernisation and a plan to regain its investment grade credit rating. Both sides want to turn around Italy's biggest phone group, a heavily indebted former state phone monopoly that has underperformed bigger peers such as Deutsche Telekom, and Orange for years. TIM's enterprise value is nearly 20 percent below that of peers as a multiple of its forward EBITDA, it faces new rivals in both broadband and mobile, and its Brazilian business is only gradually recovering from economic malaise. ""Tomorrow's AGM is a key catalyst in Telecom Italia's equity story (although) the fundamental outlook remains difficult,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Montalti, who has a 'neutral' rating on the stock. Graphic: Telecom Italia share price vs peers - https://reut.rs/2JNHd6f Other shareholders say the best outcome would be for Vivendi and Elliott to bury the hatchet and allow a more independent board to push through measures to slash its net debt of more than 25 billion euros (22 billion pounds), tackle competition and unlock value. ""Whatever slate wins at the AGM, a settlement between the two groups would be the most desirable outcome, agreeing on the key levers to create value for shareholders with a stable board of directors supportive of (CEO Amos) Genish,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note. The broker has an 'overweight' rating on TIM. Elliott has built a stake of 9 percent to try change the way Vivendi, which owns 24 percent, is running the company. New York-headquartered Elliott Management Corp manages assets of about $35 billion and is pushing for change at Telecom Italia through its London-based affiliate Elliott Advisors (UK). Friday's shareholder vote will pit the two against each other in a bid to secure the majority of TIM's 15-member board. Whatever the outcome, the two adversaries will have to co-exist with the loser bound to get the remaining five seats. ""This could be the beginning of a new era for TIM,"" a source close to the company said. ""If played well, Genish could have the chance to work in a less hostile environment."" Since becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has gradually tightened its grip on TIM, appointed the majority of its board last year and named its own CEO as TIM's executive chairman - all in the name of French tycoon Vincent Bollore's stated ambition to build a southern European media powerhouse. Two TIM CEOs left because of clashes with the French investor. The hands-on approach has led to friction with politicians in Rome, concerned about an asset they consider strategic, and has unnerved other investors at the telecoms firm. But Vivendi also brought in Genish, who managed to impress investors and the government in Rome, and whose ambitious new three-year strategy, presented in March, was welcomed. Last week shareholders nearly unanimously backed the new CEO who, despite being a Vivendi ally, is well respected for his track record in the telecoms industry. ""Genish staying is key to providing stability and execution of the business plan, particularly given the replacement of three top executives in the last three years,"" Morgan Stanley said. TRUMP CARD On Friday, shareholders will have to pick between Elliott's slate of 10 independent Italian business heavyweights and Vivendi's list, which did little to allay governance concerns. Proxy advisers recommended backing Elliott's slate, saying Vivendi had been damaging for governance and investor returns. Italian state lender CDP bought 4.8 percent of TIM, a move widely seen as political endorsement of the Elliott campaign. But Vivendi's trump card is having Genish on its list, which might prove a conundrum for some who may want to weaken the French grip but will not want to lose the CEO. Genish has said his position would be ""untenable"" if TIM ended up with a board that did not back his business plan. Elliott has repeatedly said it supports Genish and his plan. It also toned down its requests for major strategy moves, saying management and the independent board would evaluate whether and when to carry them out. The fund had originally called for selling a controlling stake in the soon-to-be-created network company, a return to dividends and the conversion of savings shares -- all measures TIM management called premature, unfeasible and carrying financial risks. If it loses on Friday, Vivendi has no wish to exit its 4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) TIM investment anytime soon and ""the fight will continue"", a source close to the matter said. TIM has often been seen as a pawn in other people's games. Before Vivendi came in, TIM was controlled by a holding company that included Italian investors and Spain's Telefonica. With Genish in charge, investors hope things could change. ""There is a lot of unrealised value in Telecom Italia and Vivendi and Elliott need to agree on a compromise, maybe brokered by Genish -- otherwise TIM gets bogged down in this boardroom battle and once again nothing gets done,"" said a fund manager at a U.S. fund that also owns TIM shares.

34,2018-05-03,U.S. Prisoner Release Would Be Goodwill Move by North Korea: White House,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/asia/03reuters-northkorea-usa.html,808," WASHINGTON —  The White House said on Thursday it would welcome the release of three Americans imprisoned in North Korea as a goodwill gesture before a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but that it could not confirm reports that they are about to be freed. Expectations have grown that North Korea would soon release the three ahead of the unprecedented summit in the coming weeks. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's new main lawyer, told Fox News Channel that Pyongyang would release them as early as Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Giuliani had direct knowledge of negotiations around the issue. CNN, citing an unnamed source, said on Thursday the prisoners' release was imminent, adding the groundwork for the move was laid two months ago when North Korea's foreign minister traveled to Sweden and proposed the idea. ""We can't confirm the validity of any of the reports currently out about their release, but we certainly would see this as a sign of goodwill if North Korea were to release the three Americans ahead of discussions between President Trump and Kim Jong Un,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The three are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong Chul, arrested in 2015; Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak Song, who also taught at PUST and was detained in 2017. Trump did not mention Korea or the prisoners when he spoke at a prayer event at the White House on Thursday. ""Our country is doing very well. You'll see some very good announcements very shortly,"" he said. On Wednesday, Trump said on Twitter, ""As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!"" But of the three, only Kim Dong Chul was arrested before Trump became president in January 2017. The U.S. government is looking into reports that the Americans had recently been relocated from a labor camp to a hotel near Pyongyang, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. The summit between Trump and Kim is expected to take place in late May or early June. DENUCLEARIZATION In preparing for the summit, Trump's administration has said it wants North Korea's ""complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization"" but has offered few details of the strategy it will employ at the talks. Kim told the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, on Thursday that he is committed to denuclearization, China's foreign ministry said, as diplomatic efforts to bring lasting peace to the Korean peninsula gather pace. ""Kim Jong Un said achieving the denuclearization of the peninsula is the firm position of the North Korean side,"" China's foreign ministry said after Wang met Kim in Pyongyang. North Korea announced on Sunday that it would close its main nuclear test site next month but some U.S. officials are skeptical that Pyongyang will give up its nuclear arsenal. Trump has promised to ensure that North Korea does not get the capability to build a nuclear bomb that can hit the mainland United States. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is postponing his plans to travel to Brazil this month in order to ensure foreign policy resources are focused on Trump's talks with Kim, Pence's spokeswoman said. The exact date and location has yet to be fixed for the meeting between Trump and Kim, who lobbed personal insults and lambasted each other last year over North Korea's nuclear arms ambitions. The change in tone has been helped by last week's meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, at which the  two pledged to work for ""complete denuclearization"" of the Korean peninsula. Trump said he would maintain pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions ahead of his own meeting with Kim. Even as Washington presses for the release of the three American prisoners, the parents of a U.S. college student who died last year soon after being release from captivity in North Korea have sued Pyongyang over their son's death, saying Otto Warmbier was ""brutally tortured and murdered."" Warmbier's parents told a meeting at the United Nations on Thursday that they would no longer be silent and believed they had to stand up for their son and other families whose loved ones had been abducted by North Korea. ""The only thing we can do is rub their noses in this. It embarrasses them,"" said Cindy Warmbier, Otto's mother. ""You can't negotiate. You just have to shame them.""

35,2018-05-03,NBC News Corrects Story on Monitoring Cohen's Phones,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-tv-nbc-cohen.html,249," NEW YORK —  NBC News corrected a story Thursday that said federal investigators had placed a wiretap on the phone lines of President Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, saying it subsequently learned that the feds were only monitoring the source of calls and weren't listening in. The correction gives ammunition to the nation's highest-ranked media critic. Trump has frequently criticized the media for ""fake news"" involving stories he doesn't like. NBC moved its original story online shortly after 1 p.m. on Thursday, and it became immediate fodder on MSNBC and other cable networks. The correction was issued online at 5:27 p.m. with an editor's note to the rewritten story, and was discussed on MSNBC's ""Meet the Press Daily."" The network had attributed its original story to two anonymous sources with knowledge of the legal proceedings against Cohen. Tom Winter, one of NBC's investigative reporters, said the sources have a track record of providing reliable information. But NBC said that three senior U.S. officials — also not identified — had disputed the account. They said the phones were monitored by a pen register, which keeps a log of phone numbers on both ends of the conversation, but does not hear the audio. ""It's still a very serious matter,"" Winter told NBC colleague Chuck Todd, noting that a judge had to sign off on placement of the pen register. ABC News tweeted that it had confirmed the original wiretap story. But it later sent a corrected tweet and deleted the old one."
36,2018-05-04,Giuliani May Have Exposed Trump to New Legal and Political Perils,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/politics/giuliani-trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels.html,1580," WASHINGTON — President Trump’s new legal team made a chaotic debut as Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was tapped recently to be one of the president’s lawyers, potentially exposed his client to legal and political danger by publicly revealing the existence of secret payments to Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer. After he moved into the White House, the president began paying Mr. Cohen $35,000 a month, Mr. Giuliani said, in part as reimbursement for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen made to a pornographic film actress to keep her from going public about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump. The president confirmed he made payments to Mr. Cohen in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday morning. The explosive revelation, which Mr. Giuliani said was intended to prove that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen violated no campaign finance laws, prompted frustration and disbelief among the president’s other legal and political advisers, some of whom said they feared the gambit could backfire. Legally, the failure to disclose the payments could be a violation of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which requires that federal officials, including Mr. Trump, report any liabilities of more than $10,000 during the preceding year. Mr. Trump’s last disclosure report, which he signed and filed in June, mentions no debt to Mr. Cohen. Politically, Mr. Giuliani’s remarks — made in television appearances and interviews — raised questions about the president’s truthfulness and created a firestorm at the White House, where aides were caught off guard and furiously sought to deflect questions they could not answer. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said she had been unaware of the payments before the interviews. “Everyone is wondering, what in the world is he doing?” said George Arzt, a longtime New York Democratic consultant who has known Mr. Giuliani for decades. “I would not have sent out Rudy to talk about the investigation. But Trump likes chaos and Trump just added to the chaos.” By the end of the day, the president and his advisers had done little to clarify the confusion that Mr. Giuliani had set in motion a night earlier. Mr. Giuliani did not consult every member of the president’s legal team, or the network of lawyers around Washington whose clients have been entangled in Mr. Trump’s legal disputes, according to several people close to the team. Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer hired by Mr. Trump on Wednesday, was not involved in Mr. Giuliani’s plans to reveal the payments to Mr. Cohen during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, one of the people said. The abrupt disclosure — which even caught Mr. Hannity, a confidant of the president’s, by surprise — set off a flurry of calls between Mr. Trump’s lawyers as they sought to determine whether Mr. Giuliani meant to reveal the president’s reimbursement. Witnesses and lawyers around Washington scoured transcripts, watched television clips and called each other in an effort to grasp the consequences of what Mr. Giuliani had said. The president’s other lawyers ultimately determined that Mr. Giuliani had consulted with Mr. Trump, people close to them said, but were left speechless about why he decided to make the disclosure in such a high-profile way and without any strategy to handle the fallout. Mr. Giuliani recognized the situation was problematic, two people close to him said, because Mr. Trump had previously said on Air Force One that he was unaware of the hush payments to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels. However, Mr. Trump and his aides see lying to or misleading the news media as far less troublesome than lying to investigators, they said. Even some of the president’s advisers said they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani’s statements that Mr. Cohen entered into a settlement, made payments to a pornographic film actress and was reimbursed by the president all without Mr. Trump’s knowing why. Mr. Giuliani’s disclosure is a sign of how Mr. Trump’s reshuffled legal team — which now includes a highly paid Washington lawyer, a famous former mayor, a constitutional lawyer who specializes in religious cases and former federal prosecutors — will function in the coming weeks as they sort out who takes the lead on representing the president. Mr. Giuliani has said he is the lead lawyer dealing with the special counsel’s investigation in Washington. But his statements on Wednesday night related to the continuing investigation in New York that is examining the conduct of Mr. Cohen. People close to the president are concerned that Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani may create more problems for themselves if they consult only with each other and leave out the other lawyers who may know more about the nuances of the cases. Mr. Trump faces a two-front battle with the Justice Department: one investigation in New York into Mr. Cohen and the special counsel investigation in Washington. Whoever runs the president’s legal defenses will almost certainly adopt a more aggressive strategy than the previous team, which was led by the Washington lawyers John Dowd and Ty Cobb. Despite the president’s desire to take on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the Justice Department, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb persuaded Mr. Trump to buy into their strategy of cooperation. The more helpful the president was, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb told him last year, the more likely the investigation would conclude by year’s end. Instead, the investigation has intensified, and the president has concluded that approach was a mistake, according to people close to him. Convinced that the investigation is a growing threat to his presidency, he has resorted to his initial inclination to fight. Mr. Trump appears to hope that Mr. Giuliani, a like-minded political street fighter from New York, will aid his combative approach. Mr. Giuliani’s comments on Wednesday and Thursday were an attempt to do just that. His aggression carried risks. Besides revealing that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen, Mr. Giuliani appeared to admit that the payment to Ms. Clifford just before Election Day in 2016 was made because of concerns about the coming vote. That could be used to argue that it was an illegal campaign contribution. “Imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Giuliani said on the Fox News program “Fox & Friends.” “Cohen didn’t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.” Violating campaign finance laws can be serious. John Edwards, a former Democratic senator and presidential hopeful, was charged with corruption for his role in trying to hide details of his affair with a videographer during his 2008 bid for the White House. Mr. Edwards’s trial ended in an acquittal on one count with the jury unable to reach a verdict on five others. Mr. Giuliani’s comments also raised fresh questions about the president’s relationship with Mr. Cohen. As Mr. Giuliani told it, Mr. Cohen entered into a legal agreement with Ms. Clifford and paid her without Mr. Trump’s knowledge. Mr. Giuliani described that as commonplace, saying he performed similar services for his own clients. But legal ethics experts said such an arrangement was highly unusual and would only expose Mr. Cohen to new questions. Lawyers are required to keep their clients fully informed of their activities and are generally prohibited from advancing money to or on behalf of their clients, said Deborah L. Rhode, a scholar on legal ethics at Stanford Law School. “This is a guy who says he’ll take a bullet for the president,” she said. “And what they’re giving him is the legal ethics equivalent of a bullet.” “Giuliani thinks he’s serving President Trump’s interest,” she said. “President Trump’s interest is not the same as Michael Cohen’s interest.” In his tweets on Thursday, Mr. Trump contradicted his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Trump said he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen and suggested that the payment to the actress could not be considered a campaign contribution. Government watchdog groups warned that willfully violating the financial disclosure laws can be punished by a fine of up to $50,000 and a year in prison. Although federal officials who lie on the forms are also typically charged with other, more serious offenses such as bribery or fraud, more than 20 officials or former officials have been charged in the past 12 years with making false statements to federal officials, a felony offense. An Environmental Protection Agency official who failed to report a source of income on the form, for instance, was convicted and sentenced to probation. “Mr. Giuliani did his client no favors,” said Norman L. Eisen, the chairman of the good-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Cohen had worked for Mr. Trump for a decade and has said he would “take a bullet” for him. Mr. Trump, however, treated Mr. Cohen poorly over the years, people familiar with their relationship have said. Ms. Clifford is suing Mr. Cohen to try to be released from the nondisclosure agreement. And Mr. Cohen is under federal investigation into possible bank fraud, raising concerns in the president’s inner circle that Mr. Trump’s longtime personal lawyer will cooperate with the government. Federal agents raided Mr. Cohen’s office and home last month and seized documents that included information about payments to Ms. Clifford. Mr. Cohen recently invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in Ms. Clifford’s lawsuit."
37,2018-05-04,"‘Atlanta’ Season 2, Episode 10: ‘FUBU’",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/arts/television/atlanta-season-2-episode-10-recap.html,1325," In the present day, Al and Earn have come to a crossroads. Al’s ready to level up in his career and Earn is little more than dead weight. “FUBU” offers the first substantial glimpse into their past, revealing that Al has a decades-old history of carrying his cousin. This week, we’re flashing back to the late ’90s, where a teenage Earn is stuck shopping with his mother. As any bored kid would do, he wanders off to explore something more interesting than down market home décor (though he’s a little long in the tooth for playfully plowing through the racks the way he does). He can’t believe his luck when he stumbles upon a neon yellow FUBU jersey, a rare hip-hop fashion find amid the store’s non-designer dreck. The next morning, Earn’s so eager to show off his newly-purchased status symbol that he’s wide-eyed and alert before his alarm clock even sounds. He grins all the way to the school bus stop, no doubt triggering instant-onset nostalgia for anyone who ever cherished that adolescent fashion “first” — be it a piece of real jewelry, a pair of de rigueur sneakers or a designer purse. He arrives at school to a chorus of exactly the kind of external validation he’d been craving. More than just impressing his peers, he manages to get a smile and a compliment from his crush, an epic feat for a teen who hasn’t yet infiltrated the in-crowd. His swelling ego gets punctured by the entrance of classmate Devon, who’s wearing the same shirt. But not exactly the same, and after the class clown notices and crows that one of the boys must be sporting a knockoff, the question of “Who has the fake FUBU?” becomes a source of schoolwide intrigue. While Earn’s stewing in his anxiety — because he knows his is the likely counterfeit — his cousin is in the principal’s office, keeping calm in the face of weighty allegations. “Do you know why you’re here today, Alfred?” the principal asks. “Racism,” Al says nonchalantly. “Not everybody’s gonna like me.” A fellow student has accused him of stealing, but the charge is small stuff that Al refuses to sweat. He knows exactly which loophole to exploit in order to avoid punishment and gets off the hook with ease. From this we learn three things: Even in his youth, Al was plain-spoken and blunt; he’s a veteran at hustling contraband; and he’s long-since figured out the system and his role in it. Earn possesses none of this prowess and that’s why his day continues to be a stomach-churner. Even as he’s flexing his brain power in biology class (“You’re pretty smart,” his cute female lab partner tells him), he shows he’s clueless when it comes to maneuvering the school’s social minefields. “If it’s fake, everybody’s gonna roast me … forever,” he says to a friend, dreading the cruel nicknames he’ll have to endure. Being white and, thus, not beholden to the same code of cultural conduct, the friend simply shrugs and says, “It doesn’t seem like a big deal to me. I’ve worn this shirt twice this week.” Everyone else seems fixated on Earn’s designer drama, from the object of his affection to upperclassmen to cafeteria workers. FUBU got its start by promoting a sense of black unity — it’s an acronym for “For Us, By Us” — but that message fell on deaf ears here. Earn’s peers were determined to delineate between the haves and have-nots and in order to protect himself from being outed as the latter, he needed that name-brand as armor. And when a single loose thread threatened to unravel everything, he turned to Alfred for counsel. “I’m not cool like you,” Earn says, scanning the hallway for oncoming tormentors. (He tells Al the shirt came from the sale rack at Marshalls, though it looked more like a secondhand store than a discount retailer.) “What should I do? I’m freakin’ out!” We’ve seen this dynamic before in “Money Bag Shawty,” when Earn couldn’t even buy respect. He repeatedly turns to Al to help him obtain the street cred that’s clearly been eluding him his whole life. Wise beyond his years, young Al recommends denying the shirt is phony, regardless of what any bullies claim. “Confidence is key,” he tells him. As ever, Earn hears Al, but doesn’t listen to him. When the resident style aficionado, Johnny, fingers him as the fake — Devon earned authenticity points for his shirt’s “Made in China” tag — Earn braces himself for a barrage of ridicule. Which is when Al comes to his rescue, flipping the script on Johnny’s ruling with some of that aforementioned confidence (as well as a little racism). “Of course this fool’s gonna say ‘Made in China.’ He’s Chinese,” Al says. It’s sound enough reasoning for the easily-swayed crowd and they set off hazing Devon relentlessly. (“I’m not Chinese, I’m Filipino,” Johnny clarifies, but no one cares.) There’s no heartwarming family-bonding moment afterward. In fact, the cousins barely even share a glance after this entire exchange. Earn simply slinks off to the school bus, gray hoodie zipped all the way to the top, and watches silently as Devon takes a heaping helping of undeserved humiliation. The next day, it’s revealed that Devon committed suicide. In addition to the hazing, he’d been coping with his parents’ divorce; the combination proved too much for him to bear. The class clown stifles a giggle, the biology teacher holds back tears and Earn just sits there wordlessly blinking, a habit he’s kept up over the years. He arrives home to a concerned mother and aunt, who’ve heard about the death. As they clip coupons, they rattle off life advice to him and Al, who’s watching TV in the next room. “People will bully you your whole life, if you let ‘em,” Al’s mother says. “You gotta stand up for yourself.” “You and your cousin gotta look out for each other,” Earn’s mother adds. As it turns out, they’ve been bound to this advice for too long and, lately, it’s been to Al’s detriment. Earn has spent years faking it, but has yet to make it. And now, seeing how long Al has had his back, it’s clear why he was reluctant to work with Earn in the first place and is eager to finally shake him off. • The period setting meant Throwback Thursday was in full effect musically, with tracks by Tracy Chapman, The Pharcyde, the recently-departed Craig Mack, Nas (with Lauryn Hill) and even a late-’80s hit by Al B. Sure! flooding this episode. • Though there is a broad mishmash of ’90s apparel and music, it seems safe to carbon date the year of this flashback as 1998, judging by the Outkast “Aquemini” poster hanging near Earn’s bed. That’s also the year that Daymond John’s streetwear label hit its peak. • It’s surprising to learn that Al was enrolled in JROTC. He doesn’t seem the type to go in for all the program’s rules and rigorousness. • There must have been some Bibby-ish shenanigans going on behind the scenes because the class clown’s haircut went from “Fresh Prince” fade during one scene to angular Bobby Brown asymmetry in the next. • We need a Denisha minisode. The auxiliary bio class character’s 180-degree turn from being despondent and combative to vivacious and overeager deserves a story of its own. • You are a black man in America. And when you meet people, you need to look good,” Earn’s mom cautions, instructing him to wear a suit at his upcoming piano lesson. “Your clothes are important.” Between school and home, he’s getting two different takes on respectability politics. • A morbid hot take: Though he may have lost the taste for it by now, the coast is probably clear for Earn to wear that second FUBU shirt his mother picked up for him."
38,2018-05-04,"Australia's Generational Wealth Divide Dominates Budget, Election Plans",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/asia/03reuters-australia-politics-budget-analysis.html,995," SYDNEY/HYAMS BEACH, Australia —  Robyn and John Marlow own two properties in Australia - one in Sydney's affluent northern beaches, which earns them a steady rental income, and a multi-million dollar, three-bedroom house where they live about 200 km (125 miles) south. The retired couple, whose rustic home borders a national park and is only steps away from Hyams Beach - reputedly the whitest sand beach on earth - are worried by calls from the opposition Labor Party to remove tax perks for wealthy retirees. Just 30 kms (18 miles) inland from the Marlows, 22-year-old Luke Sultana works as a part-time receptionist in the regional service town of Nowra. Three pawn shops along the town's main parade offer a glimpse of the economic hardship it is facing. Sultana says he has hardly any savings and job opportunities in the town are scant, leaving little prospect of getting on the property ladder that has been the source of much of the wealth for many Australian baby boomers. ""The local shopping centre is probably the best chance of a job in Nowra. It is either that or you have to leave,"" said Sultana, adding he will vote for Labor at next election because of their support for young and low-income workers. Australia has enjoyed an extraordinary 26 years of growth without a recession but is now facing a populist wave that has hit the United States and Britain as income and wealth inequality widen. The growing divide between wealthy baby boomers and struggling younger voters poses a big problem for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull who must win marginal seats like Gilmore - which includes Hyams Beach and Nowra - at the 2019 election if he is to retain control in Canberra. Turnbull's Liberal-National coalition government, which has been trailing in polls for more than two years, is targeting next week's federal budget to seize back the policy initiative. In recent days, it has committed to expensive education and health programmes, usually a domain of state governments and Labor. Treasurer Scott Morrison defended the government's populist approach, saying a commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2020 is intact and better-than-expected revenues have allowed higher spending on key projects. At the same time, Labor has promised to make Australia's wealth and income inequality a centrepiece of its election campaign as it targets younger voters. RICH DAD, POOR DAD Australia's A$1.8 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy survived the end of a once-in-a-century mining boom thanks partly to the influx of Chinese visitors who bolstered tourism and education sectors. A surge in house prices that rekindled housing construction and boosted the net worth of home owners and property investors also played a key role. Over the past 12 years, middle and high-wealth households enjoyed a real increase in average net worth of 31-58 percent, government data shows. But low-wealth households saw no real rise in that period. As an illustration of higher income inequality, Australia's Gini Coefficient has been rising and at 0.3, is greater than Canada and most European countries, according to OECD data. What's more, the Gini coefficient of Australia's household net worth is double that, at 0.6, underscoring the big wealth disparity in a country that has prided itself on a ""fair go"" for all mentality. Median home values are now at A$875,816 in Sydney - almost eight times average gross income - making owning a house an elusive dream for many young workers. Their problems are exacerbated by stagnant wage growth of 2 percent compared with 4 percent or higher during the hay days of the mining boom. Worryingly, the rate of underemployment - those wanting to work more hours - for those aged 15-24 has stayed near historic highs of 17-19 percent in recent years, compared with 10-12 percent before the 2008 global financial crisis. A study based on government data by research firm McCrindle shows the top 20 percent households in Australia own 62 percent of private wealth. That amounts to a whopping 80 times the average of those in the bottom 20 percent. Kasy Chambers, Executive Director of community service organisation Anglicare Australia, blames the tax system. ""We have become a country that cuts from the poorest to give to the richest,"" Chambers said. A report commissioned by Anglicare showed tax benefits for pension savings, known locally as superannuation, plus capital gains to the richest 20 percent cost taxpayers more than A$60 billion year. The bottom 20 percent of Australians by wealth receive only about A$5 billion in such benefits. Labor has pledged to cut capital gains tax discounts and scrap a favourable tax scheme for multiple property owners called negative gearing. Both have been blamed for adding to frothiness in the property market, but are popular with wealthy voters the government wants to keep on side. ""Abolishing negative gearing, which has been part of our housing markets for a century, and increasing capital gains tax, would clearly have a more substantial and dislocating impact, placing more than just our credit rating at risk,"" Morrison told reporters last week. TUG OF WAR While house prices are one sore point for young voters, the lack of job opportunities is another. Youth unemployment in Nowra at 30 percent is almost six times the national average, according to research by advocacy group Brotherhood of St Laurence. Political analysts say Turnbull risks losing Gilmore, a seat that helped him win the last election by the slimmest of margins, if he does not deliver on his party's mantra of ""jobs and growth for Australians"". Offering Turnbull a route to re-election, however, is the large percentage of retirees that call Gilmore home.      Lured by beachside living, 34 percent of voters are over 60 years old - many like the Marlows who are rattled by Labor's plans. ""We can't vote for Labor when they want to lower our superannuation,"" said Robyn Marlow. (Reporting by Colin Packham in Jervis Bay and Swati Pandey in SYDNEY; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)"
39,2018-05-04,Xerox Appeals Decision Blocking Fujifilm Deal as CEO Returns,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-xerox-m-a-fujifilm.html,653," (Reuters) - Xerox Corp on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings, just hours after the company announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place. Xerox said its entire board and management team would stay, as the agreement to oust them reached with dissenting shareholders Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn expired late Thursday. Xerox's changing its mind on the settlement was ""extraordinary and highly unusual,"" said Guhan Subramanian, a professor at Harvard's law and business schools who served as an expert witness for Xerox in the litigation. Officially, Xerox and the activists said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalise their settlement ahead of a self-imposed deadline Thursday evening. A source familiar with the matter said Xerox's board let the settlement expire because it came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm. Xerox's board also took into account that the company's shares had fallen more than 10 percent since it announced its settlement with the activists. The judge said in a hearing on May 3 that he was not prohibiting Xerox from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm, according to a court transcript. In fact, Xerox has already started renegotiating its deal with Fujifilm, according to the source, who did not want to be identified because the matter is private. The companies are discussing adding $5 a share to the $2.5 billion special cash dividend of roughly $9.80 per share that Xerox shareholders would receive as part of the deal, the person said. The two companies could also come up with a new structure all together, the person added. Fujifilm declined to comment on the negotiations on Friday, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Xerox shares closed little changed at $28.38 per share on Friday. AMMUNITION FOR ACTIVISTS? Xerox and Fujifilm agreed in late January to a $6.1 billion deal that would merge the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm. A New York court temporarily blocked the transaction last week, saying that Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson was ""hopelessly conflicted"" and that he sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations. In its appeal on Friday, Xerox disputed the court's findings that the board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the deal and said the board unanimously authorized the deal. Meanwhile, Deason and Icahn, who own about 15 percent of the company, have vowed to keep fighting Xerox, and will nominate a slate of directors at the company's upcoming annual board meeting. Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at University of Delaware, said the confusing turn of events at Xerox ""give the activists more ammunition"" in a proxy fight. Deason and Icahn have argued that Xerox's board acted in a self-interested fashion and failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company. Xerox's board has also been exploring its options. Reuters previously reported that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has approached Xerox to express interest in a possible acquisition. Fujifilm, which had objected to the settlement between Xerox and the activists, said it was satisfied that Xerox had not settled with the activists this week. Fujifilm is also planning to appeal last week's court order and said in a statement on Friday that Xerox shareholders should decide for themselves the merits of any deal. But a deal under new terms between Fujifilm and Xerox is far from certain. Fujifilm shares have been falling since the deal announcement in late January as investors have been questioning the benefits of the deal. (Reporting by Liana B.

41,2018-05-04,"China to Suspend Checks on U.S. Scrap Metal Shipments, Halting Imports",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/asia/04reuters-china-waste-united-states.html,283," BEIJING/MELBOURNE —  The North American unit of a Chinese customs inspection firm said it would suspend checks on cargoes of scrap metal from the United States for a month from Friday, effectively halting all imports of U.S. scrap. The suspension comes amid a broad crackdown on pollution in China and stricter regulation around waste imports. It poses a serious headache for China's scrap buyers: the United States is a major source of scrap metal for China and top supplier of scrap copper. In a notice to customers dated May 3, reviewed by Reuters, China Certification and Inspection Group (CCIC) North America said it would stop processing applications and issuing certificates for scrap material shipments from May 4 to June 4. The company could not immediately be reached for comment outside normal working hours in the United States. The inspection firm said in the notice it would empty every container of U.S.-origin scrap from May 4 to check for plastic and other hazardous waste products, which it would send for further testing. During the month-long period, CCIC North America ""will temporarily stop processing applications and issuing the certificate for pre-shipment inspection on scrap materials to China,"" it said. Last year, China imported a total of 5.74 million tonnes of scrap metal, mainly scrap copper and aluminum, according to official data. But imports have fallen sharply year on year so far in 2018 as quotas have been progressively tightened. China imported 50,000 tonnes of copper scrap from the U.S. in March and more than 500,000 tonnes last year, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's secondary supply.

42,2018-05-04,"Italy's League Sets Terms for Stopgap Govt, 5-Star Wants Election",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-italy-politics.html,603," ROME —  The anti-immigrant League laid down on Friday its terms for the formation of a stopgap government in Italy tasked with writing a 2019 budget and preparing for new elections after an inconclusive vote in March. However, it was far from clear if the League's opponents would back its demands, including that the prime minister should come from centre-right ranks, with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement seeking a re-vote in June to end the deadlock. President Sergio Mattarella has called a final round of talks with party leaders on Monday to try to secure a coalition deal but, failing that, he is expected to seek support for a technocrat, unity government to draw up the budget. League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters any such administration had to take into account that a centre-right alliance, including his own party, had taken the most seats in parliament at the March 4 ballot. ""We will tell Mattarella that, in the case of an interim government, the (prime minister) must come from the ranks of the side that won and not be a technocrat,"" Salvini said. He said such an administration could last six months and look to revise Italy's much-maligned electoral law, as well as approve a budget to stave off the looming threat of a scheduled jump in sales taxes. Salvini called on 5-Star, which emerged as the largest single party in March, to back the idea, adding that he did not want the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) on board. There was no immediate reaction from 5-Star, but everything Salvini said seemed to run counter to what the anti-system group has been calling for after its own solutions to end nine weeks of political stalemate got gunned down by its rivals. NO MAJORITY In an interview with Il Fatto Quotidiano newspaper on Friday 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said an election should be held on June 24, waving away concerns that there was no time to organise it and dismissing the need for a stopgap administration. ""Once a government starts, it will cling on at all costs,"" he said. He also rejected suggestions that parliament should revise the electoral law yet again to try to stave off future deadlock: ""It can't be done. We would waste years arguing about it."" The last four Italian prime ministers took office thanks to backroom deals rather than ballot-box victories, and repeated efforts to devise an electoral law allowing the swift formation of a government have failed to come up with a winning formula. No group came close to securing an absolute majority on March 4 and a matrix of vetoes has prevented the parties from doing a deal, with friction and frustration growing by the day. Mattarella has made clear he does not want to dissolve parliament immediately. A source in his office told Reuters on Wednesday that if a government could not take power with a stable majority, elections would be inevitable in the autumn. Opinion polls suggest a new vote would still end in stalemate, although the centre-right is gaining ground. A survey by Demopolis released on Thursday put 5-Star on 33.2 percent against the 32.7 percent they won in March, while the centre-right bloc was forecast to take 39.5 percent against 37.1 and the centre-left 21.1 percent from 22.8. The biggest change was seen within the rightist alliance, with support for the eurosceptic League jumping to 22.9 percent from 17.4 percent and backing for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia dropping to 12.2 percent from 14.0.

43,2018-05-04,Nobel Literature Prize Award Postponed Amid Turmoil Over Sex Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-nobel-prize.html,768," STOCKHOLM —  The Swedish Academy which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature said on Friday it would not make the award this year because of a sexual misconduct scandal that has caused turmoil in its ranks and led to a string of board members stepping down. The prize, one of the world's most prestigious cultural honours, is awarded in early October and a postponement or cancellation has not occurred in decades. But the usually secretive Academy acknowledged it needed time to restore public trust after allegations against the husband of one of its members and the admission that the names of some prize-winners had been leaked. The Academy, composed of Sweden's literary elite, said it aimed to award two prizes in 2019, including the 2018 one. ""We find it necessary to commit time to recovering public confidence in the Academy before the next laureate can be announced,"" Anders Olsson, who is interim Permanent Secretary of the Academy, said in a statement. The turmoil caused by sexual allegations against the husband of one of the board members is unprecedented for the Academy, a revered institution established by King Gustav III in 1786 and still under royal patronage. King Carl XVI Gustaf led public comment welcoming the body's decision on Friday. ""This decision shows that the Academy now intends to focus on restoring its reputation,"" he said in a statement. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it was important that the Academy ""now tirelessly continues to work on regaining (public) confidence."" Though the Academy has courted controversy in the past, for example by awarding the 2016 prize to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, debate has usually focussed on literary merit rather than the institution itself. It found itself suddenly at the centre of attention after allegations of sexual harassment and assault were made by 18 women against photographer and cultural figure Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to Academy member and author Katarina Frostenson. He denies the allegations. NECESSARY DECISION The Academy provided financial support for a cultural club run by Arnault and Frostenson. Three members of the Academy's board resigned because of dissatisfaction over the way a probe into the allegations was conducted. The Academy's head and Frostenson also subsequently stepped down followed by a sixth member last week. ""It think this was a necessary decision, mainly in regard to the legitimacy of the prize,"" Peter Englund, one of the six members to have left the Academy in recent weeks, told Reuters in an email regarding the decision to postpone the prize. The Academy also disclosed that an investigation had shown that the names of some prize winners - the subject of lively betting - had been leaked. Arnault denies all allegations, regarding both sexual misconduct and leaking the names of laureates, his lawyer told Reuters on Thursday. State prosecutors opened an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations, but said in March the probe into assaults alleged to have been committed between March 2013 and April 2015 had been dropped due to a lack of evidence and the statute of limitations having passed for some of the incidents. Prosecutor Christina Voigt told Reuters on Friday a preliminary investigation concerning Arnault was still underway, but declined to say how many alleged incidents this involved. TRANSPARENCY The Nobel prizes and the international attention they bring are a source of pride for Sweden and the Academy has promised to improve transparency and bring its ancient rules up to date. Previous breaks in the annual tradition go back to World War Two. There were no awards between 1940 and 1943, while American novelist William Faulkner received his prize a year late in 1950 when two prizes were handed out. The Nobel Foundation, which administers the estate of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, said the crisis at the Academy had ""adversely affected"" the Nobel Prize. ""Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the Nobel Prize,"" the Foundation said in statement. Arcane rules that make appointments for life have so far meant that the 18 Academy members have not been able to technically resign and the body had already been decimated even before the recent string of defections. Two members had ceased participating in the Academy's work over its initial refusal to explicitly condemn a fatwa issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini calling on Muslims to kill British-Indian author Salman Rushdie because of perceived blasphemy in his novel ""The Satanic Verses"". The Swedish King this week changed the rules, making it possible to appoint new members. (Reporting by Simon Johnson, Niklas Pollard, Johan Sennero and Esha Vaish; Editing by Richard Balmforth)"
44,2018-05-04,"Stocks Jump, With Buffett Helping Apple to New Highs",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/world/asia/ap-financial-markets.html,875," NEW YORK —  U.S. stocks made up for a shaky week with a strong finish Friday as Apple led a rally in technology companies. The tech giant hit an all-time high after Warren Buffett said he'd made another big investment. Stocks got off to a mixed start after trade talks between the U.S. and China ended with few signs of progress. The April jobs report showed that hiring continued at a solid clip and wages continued to grow at a slow pace. Apple surged after Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares during the first quarter. Alphabet, Cisco Systems and other technology companies rose, and retailers, banks, and household goods makers also rallied. Investors also cheered strong first-quarter results from companies including Shake Shack and Activision Blizzard. ""We went into this earnings season with very high expectations,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief markets strategist for Prudential Financial. ""When you go in with such high expectations, you expect near perfection."" The S&P 500 index climbed 33.69 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,663.42. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 332.36 points, or 1.4 percent, to 24,262.51. The Nasdaq composite jumped 121.47 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,209.62. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 19.05 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,565.60. Overall, stocks have taken small losses in choppy trading over the last two weeks. But for Apple, this was the best week in six and a half years. Apple rose 3.9 percent to $183.83 after Warren Buffett told CNBC his company boosted its investment in Apple to more than 240 million shares altogether. Buffett told CNBC about the purchase ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting this weekend. Berkshire stock rose 2.1 percent to $195.64. Apple climbed 13.3 percent for the week after it reported solid quarterly results and investors were pleased with its forecast of solid iPhone sales, which came as a relief. It also raised its dividend and announced a big stock repurchase. Companies have done well in the first quarter, but stocks haven't necessarily followed suit as investors worried about the U.S.-China trade spat, rising interest rates, and other issues. But on Friday investors responded. After better-than-expected reports, burger chain Shake Shack surged 18 percent to $55.95 while music streaming company Pandora Media advanced 19.8 percent to $6.89. Video game maker Activision Blizzard gained 4.5 percent to $69.84. The stock had dipped Thursday afternoon after Activision's results were released early. U.S. employers stepped up hiring modestly in April, and the hiring estimate from March was revised higher. That's evident the economy remains resilient even though some businesses are concerned about a possible trade war. While many employers say it's difficult to find qualified workers, they have yet to significantly boost pay in most industries, a trend that continued last month. ""That may not be good for Main Street, but it's what Wall Street wanted to see,"" said Krosby, of Prudential. The Trump administration asked China to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion by the end of 2020, striking an assertive stance in talks aimed at averting a trade war between the world's largest economies. It also wants China to immediately stop providing subsidies to certain industries listed in a key industrial plan and end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute. While the trade tensions have rattled investors, many market watchers think the two sides will eventually come to a deal that doesn't disrupt trade much. Engineering and construction company Fluor plunged after it slashed its profit forecast because a gas-fired power project suffered ""continued challenges."" The company took an unexpected loss in the first quarter and now expects a profit of $2.10 to $2.50 per share for the year, down from 2$3.10 to $3.50 per share. The stock dropped 22.4 percent to $45.76. Bond prices rose early, but later gave up that gain. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 percent from 2.48 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.95 percent. That helped banks recover from an early loss. Lower bond yields mean lower rates for mortgages and other types of loans, which reduces profits for banks. Companies that pay big dividends didn't rise as much as the rest of the market. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.9 percent to $69.72 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 1.7 percent to $74.87 per barrel in London.

45,2018-05-04,Analysts: US Trade Demands Could Make Deal With China Harder,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/world/asia/ap-as-china-us-trade.html,1152," BEIJING —  A list of hard-line demands that the Trump administration handed China this week could make it even more difficult to resolve a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies. That's the view of trade analysts who say the U.S. insistence that Beijing shrink America's gaping trade deficit with China by $200 billion by the end of 2020, among other demands, are more likely to raise tensions than to calm them. A U.S. official confirmed the authenticity of a document outlining U.S. priorities that was presented to China ahead of two days of trade talks that ended Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the talks. In Washington on Friday, President Donald Trump said, ""We have to bring fairness in trade between the U.S. and China, and we will do that."" Trump had campaigned for the presidency on a promise to reduce America's trade deficit with China, which amounted last year to $337 billion in goods and services. ""We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!"" Trump tweeted. The intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China has rattled financial markets for weeks. In March, the Trump administration slapped tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. China counterpunched with tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including bourbon and blue jeans. An even higher-stakes fight looms over American allegations that China steals technology and forces U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. The United States is considering imposing tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing has countered with proposed tariffs on $50 billion in American products, including soybeans and small aircraft. Seeking to avert a trade war, the United States this week sent a high-level delegation to Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The delegation included Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser and hard-line critic of Chinese policies. After the talks ended, China's Commerce Ministry said the two sides had agreed to establish a mechanism to try to resolve their dispute, though differences remained, Chinese state media reported. The report did not give specifics, suggesting that little progress had been achieved. The U.S. document is described, in an introductory disclaimer, as being provided to the Chinese ahead of the visit to Beijing by the U.S. officials. It included demands that China immediately stop providing subsidies to industries listed in a key industrial plan. China must end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute, the list also says. The U.S. wants China not to retaliate against U.S. measures currently being pursued against it. For instance, the U.S. says China should agree not to target U.S. farmers or agricultural products and ""not oppose, challenge or otherwise retaliate"" when the U.S. moves to restrict Chinese investment in the U.S. in sensitive sectors. American analysts were struck by the aggressiveness of the Trump team's demands. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the hard-nosed approach ""makes it harder to envision a path toward a negotiated settlement."" Prasad said the Chinese are open to negotiations on opening their market wider and doing a better job of protecting intellectual property. ""Beijing is clearly in no mood, however, to meet the U.S. team's expectation of capitulation in the face of threats of tariffs and other trade sanctions,"" he said. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who specialized in Asia, said it was encouraging to see the two countries talking and trading proposals. But she said the ""kitchen sink"" U.S. demands look unrealistic. ""If the U.S. is serious and wants all of this, it's hard to see a constructive path forward,"" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Analysts said the Chinese were likely to view the confrontational posture struck by the U.S. as unreasonable and akin to bullying, potentially making it difficult to tone down friction over such issues. Yu Miaojie, a professor at Peking University's National School of Development, described some of the demands as ""like lions opening their mouths."" ""When it comes to negotiations, both sides can provide a list of requests and we will seek common ground while reserving our differences,"" Yu said. ""If one side provides a list with unreasonable requests, the Chinese government is unable to accept it."" ""China won't be frightened by this kind of threat,"" wrote Hu Xijin, the chief editor of the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid affiliated with the Communist Party mouthpiece, in a post on the Sina Weibo website. Hu said he believed China would engage in talks seriously but also be fully prepared for them to fail. Still, the list was welcomed by a U.S. business group which has lobbied the Trump administration for greater clarity on what it wanted China to do. Some groups had complained the administration was sending mixed messages. ""We've been saying that the Trump administration needs to define success and what specific outcomes it is seeking,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China of the U.S.-China Business Council. The list submitted to China helps ""lead to a solution and avoid tariffs and other sanctions,"" he said. The two sides ""reached consensus in some areas,"" the official Xinhua News Agency said. ""Both sides realized that there are still relatively big differences over some issues and that they need to continue to work hard to make more improvements,"" the report said. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. delegation. A motorcade was seen leaving the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Friday afternoon and the group departed China later in the day. The list of U.S. demands was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Friday. The dispute will be tough to resolve because the fundamental issue is that the U.S. wants to stop China from moving up the so-called value chain as it transforms into an advanced economy, said Louis Kuijs, head Asia economist at Oxford Economics. But ""there's no way that China's going to change its strategy on that."" Kuijs said the ball is now in the U.S. court on deciding whether the talks were fruitful and merit more discussion or that they're stalled and Washington needs to take more serious measures targeting China. This is ""much more than just a trade dispute,"" Kuijs said. ""This is very much about economic strategy and the U.S. coming to grips with a big country running its economy in a way that the U.S. is uncomfortable with, and becoming successful, and starting to threaten U.S. dominance."" ___ Wiseman reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong, Martin Crutsinger in Washington and Christopher Bodeen and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report."

Ying says the U.S. side took the complaints seriously and agreed to report them to Trump. China objected strongly when the U.S. last month banned American companies from selling technology to ZTE for seven years, calling that unfair. ZTE pleaded guilty in March 2017 and agreed to pay a $1.19 billion penalty for having shipped equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of U.S. regulations. The U.S. Commerce Department said employees involved were paid bonuses instead of being punished. ___ 4:30 p.m. China's state media says talks in Beijing with U.S. officials ended with an agreement to set up a mechanism to work through an escalating dispute over trade.

The report says the two sides ""reached consensus in some areas,"" but did not provide specifics. Earlier Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sounded a positive note about talks aimed at easing tensions that have taken the countries close to a trade war."
47,2018-05-04,Dorothea Rockburne’s Ephemeral Art and Enduring Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/dorothea-rockburne-artist-dia-beacon.html,1426," At 85, the painter Dorothea Rockburne is still blazing trails, making art in the unorthodox way she has for seven decades. “There’s stuff in my head,” Ms. Rockburne, an abstractionist with lively, penetrating eyes and a ready smile, recently explained. “It’s really important for me to get it out of my head and into a viewable situation.’’ From experience, she’s learned that it can take a while to figure out how to get concepts onto a wall or canvas. It took about a year, for example, to figure out how to recreate several of her breakthrough works from 1967 through 1972 for a show opening Sunday at Dia Art Foundation in Beacon, N.Y. It will be the first time generations of art enthusiasts will see the work of this underappreciated artist in person, rather than from reproductions in catalogs and art magazines. It had been almost 50 years since the artist herself had seen some of them. But would she ever have a chance to see them again? The painter took risks back then, choosing ephemeral materials with a short shelf life. Take the large installation on view at Dia, “Domain of the Variable,” a re-creation of the original that appeared on the cover of the November 1972 issue of Artforum — then the art world’s bible — and is Ms. Rockburne’s best-known work. Composed of cotton rag paper, specially ordered chipboard, grease and charcoal, it was one of many large-scale works executed at a time when painters and sculptors made art with no regard for whether their pieces could be sold. When her second show at the Bykert Gallery on East 81st Street closed in the 1970s, “Domain of the Variable,” parts of which had been glued to the wall, had to be tossed in the garbage. Years earlier, Ms. Rockburne discovered that the paper she used would no longer be manufactured, and she purchased rolls of it. They, too, had disintegrated. Other multipart paintings had been executed with crude oil, specially ordered chipboard, electrical tape, nails and tar. But crude oil, a component in homemade bombs, was no longer available. (It’s also toxic.) Heidie Giannotti, the exhibition designer, substituted heating oil. Reconstructing the art on view in Beacon took months, lots of trial and error, and a team of six installers to get everything right. “At Dia, we substituted materials, but it didn’t matter,” Ms. Rockburne said, explaining that she’ll use any material that produces the desired effect. You learn to roll with the punches when you have exhibited in celebrated avant-garde galleries; enjoyed friendships with A-list artists, dancers, poets, and musicians — Robert Rauschenburg, Cy Twombly, Merce Cunningham among them; managed as a single mother to pay the rent on a downtown loft where you made your work late into the night; and made your career taking on the big boys of the art world. Ms. Rockburne’s understated work plugged into the prevailing Minimalist aesthetic of the day but also reflected her lifelong interest in higher mathematics. Indeed, she refers to herself as both an artist and a mathematician. When people hear her talk about how her art relates to higher mathematics, they often roll their eyes. According to Ms. Rockburne, “everyone had terrible math teachers, but I didn’t.” “Domain of the Variable” is a visual equation, setting out specific material variations within a single installation. There was another aspect to her paintings. As the artist said in her spacious, well-lit loft on the edge of SoHo, “Even though it has an intellectual basis and mathematical structure, my work comes from a deep emotional source within me.” Ms. Rockburne explained that someone could appreciate her art without being familiar with math. As she put it, “you don’t have to know the composition of water to swim in it.” But then, she added, “once you know what water is, and that we’re 90 percent water, it becomes more interesting.” Ms. Rockburne’s interest in mathematics was a gradual process. Raised in Montreal, she fell under the spell of illustrated books that her Welsh-born mother found on a trip to Alexandria, on Egyptian art. They fascinated her young daughter, who turned their pages avidly when she suffered from bronchitis and pneumonia during the long, bitter Canadian winters. (A number of paintings from Ms. Rockburne’s Egyptian series of 1979-81, comprising black crayon lines, and gessoed and painted white linen folded into geometric shapes and borders, will open at Dia: Beacon next November.) Ms. Rockburne earned a scholarship at 16 to the Montreal Museum School. As she approached graduation, her two favorite art teachers counseled her to leave Canada, recommending that she attend Black Mountain College in North Carolina. When she got there, she found her calling. She studied art with the Abstract Expressionists Philip Guston, Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov; dance, with Merce Cunningham; music with the composers John Cage and Lou Harrison; poetry, with the postmodernist Charles Olson. Then, there were her fellow students: John Chamberlain, Twombly and Rauschenberg. “Bob whispered in my ear, I have a car,” she recalled. “We three became thick, and fast friends.” Yet, she has always acknowledged that she is most indebted to her mathematics professor, the German émigré Max Dehn. She admired Dehn’s “lively, disciplined but fearless mind. His enthusiasm for everything was infectious.” “When I told him that I was having difficulties with assignments,” she explained, “he said, ‘What you need is to understand the principles of math as they occur in nature.’” Consequently, he invited her to join him on his 7 a.m. hikes. Her fate was sealed. In 1954, Ms. Rockburne arrived in New York with her husband, Carroll Warner Williams, an instructor she had met at Black Mountain, and their 2-year-old daughter, Christine. The marriage didn’t work out; and in 1958, she moved with her daughter from a cold water flat in the East 80s to a loft on Chambers Street. Now she was hanging out with future Pop artists and Minimalists (Claes Oldenburg, Carl Andre, Robert Morris). The sculptor Mark di Suvero built a big swing in the backyard where her daughter played. In the morning, Ms. Rockburne, a single mother, would bring her daughter uptown to school at Dalton. She’d paint from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. To cover expenses, she held a series of day jobs, including one as a waitress, and another as a “girl Friday” for Rauschenberg. When she grew disappointed with the art she was making, she took a break. Ms. Rockburne joined the now legendary Judson Dance Theater. “They were young and revolutionary and wanted to change the world,” Ms. Rockburne said during a dinner in SoHo. “They had a huge influence on me; and I realized why I was dissatisfied. In the middle of a performance, I suddenly saw what I wanted to do. I never danced again.” She began making the art that secured her reputation. Initially, Ms. Rockburne was inspired by set theory, a branch of mathematical logic. “Tropical Tan” (1967-68), named for a color of paint, and also for human tan skin, is the earliest work on view at Dia: Beacon. Four 8-foot-tall steel panels resting side-by-side were covered with wrinkle finish paint, which created a subtle texture on the smooth metal. “Set,” a refined beauty, has also been newly rendered, now taller than ever, partly because of the high ceilings at the former Nabisco plant that serves as Dia’s home. “Variable” is an astonishing introduction to Ms. Rockburne’s radicality during the early 1970s. The two-part installation encompasses an entire room. One section involves various pieces of paper and board covered with red grease, adding a striking color note. Paper board glued to the wall and then stripped off like a Band-Aid leaves vibrant traces of a rupture. A long line carved into the wall between the two pieces, provides a deep shadow. The overall impact is “a controlled chaos,” said Courtney J. Martin, the deputy director and chief curator of Dia. “The grease could have run; the wall could have been pulled apart, And yet neither of those things happened.” This work, she added, “always deserved more attention than it received.” Jessica Morgan, Dia’s director, pointed out that Ms. Rockburne’s practice encompasses “both a rigor of thinking with an equally exacting desire to create sensuality in the work.” She added, “It remains radically surprising in its form, material, process and conceptual underpinning.” With the Dia installation completed, Ms. Rockburne was asked what it was like to be young and idealistic during the ’60s. Without missing a beat, she replied, “I am young and idealistic.”"
48,2018-05-04,Lasers and Missiles Heighten U.S.-China Military Tensions,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/asia/china-united-states-lasers-pilots.html,902," BEIJING — Tensions between the United States and China flared on two military fronts as Washington accused the Chinese of harassing American pilots flying over the African nation of Djibouti and warned of consequences to the deployment of missiles on artificial islands China has built in disputed waters in the South China Sea. The Pentagon’s spokeswoman, Dana W. White, said Thursday that personnel at China’s military base in Djibouti have in recent weeks been aiming powerful lasers at American aircraft that also operate in or near the country, which is where the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden meet. She did not detail the number of incidents but said the lasers — which can be used to target aircraft — caused minor eye injuries to two American pilots. The accusations came a time when the two countries have found themselves increasingly at odds, particularly over trade, which was the subject of a second day of talks here in Beijing attended by President Trump’s senior economic advisers and their Chinese counterparts. The episodes in Djibouti heightened concerns in Washington about China’s growing military assertiveness in a vast region from the Horn of Africa to the Pacific. The modernization of China’s military has been a core mission of the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, who has recently presided over displays of military might on land and sea and appears eager to challenge American military supremacy in Asia. The United States also objected to the deployment of antiaircraft and anti-ship missiles on islands that China claims in the South China Sea. Such deployments have been reported before, but never before have they been so explicitly confirmed by American and Chinese officials. The deployments contradict assurances that Mr. Xi made to President Barack Obama in 2015 not to “militarize” the area. “We’ve raised concerns directly with the Chinese about this,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said on Thursday when asked if the deployment of missiles in the South China Sea crossed “a red line” for the United States. “And there will be near-term and long-term consequences,” she added. The Chinese appeared unfazed by the warnings. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the deployment of weapons to the islands, saying they were defensive and intended “to safeguard China’s sovereignty and security.” “The relevant deployment targets no one,” Ms. Hua said when asked about a report by CNBC that the missiles had been deployed in the past month on three Chinese bases in the Spratly Islands: Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs. Such missile systems could threaten aircraft and ships that approach the disputed territories — something the United States makes a point of doing periodically to exercise freedom of navigation naval exercises within what it considers international waters. “Anyone with no invasive intention will find no reason to worry about this,” she added. While China has long claimed the islands, reefs and other outcroppings within the South China Sea, other nations also have claims there, including Vietnam and the Philippines. China’s vast reclamation project, which began in earnest in 2013, shortly after Mr. Xi became the country’s paramount leader, has steadily turned once-uninhabited places into fortified islands with airfields and increasingly military outposts. In doing so it has brushed aside warnings from the United States and other nations and even a ruling against its territorial claims by an international arbitration panel in 2016. China’s base in Djibouti, its first overseas, has long been a source of concern for the United States and other militaries operating around the Horn of Africa. It opened last year and has been portrayed by the Chinese as a logistics base to support antipiracy, counterterrorism and humanitarian operations in Africa and the Middle East. It also happens to be just a few miles from the only permanent American base in Africa, which was established after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The base, operated by the Navy adjacent to Djibouti’s international airport, is home to some 4,000 personnel, including those involved in highly secretive missions in the region, including at least two Navy SEAL raids into Yemen. The use of lasers was first made public in April in a warning to pilots issued by the Federal Aviation Administration. It noted that there had been multiple instances of “a high-power laser” being used near where the Chinese base is. Using lasers to disorient or disable pilots is an old military tactic, but an international protocol adopted in 1995 and joined by China prohibits the practice. Ms. White said that there was no doubt about the origin of the lasers, and that the Pentagon had asked the Chinese to investigate. “It’s a serious matter,” she said, “and so we’re taking it very seriously.” In a statement on Friday afternoon, China’s Ministry of National Defense strongly disputed the Pentagon’s accusations, saying they were “completely inconsistent with fact.” The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper that often takes a hawkish line, published an article in English on Wednesday — before the Pentagon’s briefing on the injuries to two American pilots — that quoted military experts calling the accusations phony. A longer article in Chinese, however, gave other benign explanations for the incidents. In any case, the article asked, why were the Americans flying so close to the Chinese base? “In this regard,” it went on, suggestively, “the Americans seem to be shouting ‘thief’ to get away with their own crimes.”"
49,2018-05-04,Germany's DZ Bank to Sell Parts of DVB After Muted Interest for Whole Business-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-dzbank-dvb-sale.html,750," LONDON/FRANKFURT —  Germany's No.2 lender DZ Bank plans to sell certain assets of its troubled ship and aircraft financing division DVB after receiving muted interest for the whole business, four sources familiar with the matter said. The sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, said DZ Bank, which is also the umbrella organisation of German cooperative bank chain Raiffeisen-Volksbanken, would start by selling DVB's aviation and land transport finance portfolios, followed by its shipping and offshore portfolios. Two of the sources said asset managers Apollo Global Management and Cerberus Capital Management were interested in the aviation segment. Cerberus and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Another source said there was potential interest from Japanese buyers including financial services firm Orix Corp. Orix declined to comment. Orix in the past has acquired shipping loans from the Royal Bank of Scotland. One source said the first round of bids for the aviation and land transport portfolios are expected later in May, with final bids due in July. The source said the bank would launch the sale of the shipping and offshore segments in the autumn. DZ and DVB both declined to comment when contacted. DVB, previously among the leading lenders to the shipping industry, saw its annual pretax loss triple last year to 774 million euros (683 million pounds) and DZ Bank said in February it had raised provisions for bad shipping loans and was considering ""all options"" for the unit. DVB is unusual in banking because it straddles both aviation and shipping, and both lending and leasing – a combination rarely found in one package. ""DZ Bank has decided to now opt for portfolio sales and is no longer trying to sell the bank as a whole,"" one of the sources said. ""The aviation business is strong and that market is attractive. One of the issues they are going to have to face are the problems with the shipping portfolio and whether they can find enough interest for it."" DZ Bank's Chief Executive Wolfgang Kirsch had said on Feb. 27 that it had already received initial expressions of interest for certain portfolios and parts of DVB. Sources told Reuters in February that the Bank of China (BOC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) had been among the suitors looking at a potential purchase of DVB Bank. Others included Apollo, they added. One source said ICBC and BOC looked at the bank but did not make any offer. Since then, other sources said Canadian private equity group Onex had also expressed interest, but did not pursue an approach. Onex did not respond to requests for comment. It was unclear what offer was made although it was deemed too low by DZ Bank, the sources said. DZ Bank's Chief Financial Officer Cornelius Riese in February separately ruled out any fire sales, adding that the wind down of DVB would take a while. ""None of us are so naive as to believe that the DVB theme will be solved by the end of the year,"" said Riese. DVB Bank's lending volume by the end of 2017 totalled 19.4 billion euros, with shipping accounting for 9.5 billion euros, followed by aviation at 6.1 billion euros, the offshore business at 1.8 billion euros, land transport at 1.4 billion euros and other activities making up the remaining 600 million euros, according to data from DZ Bank's annual presentation. SHIPPING DVB has scaled back new business, but tough shipping conditions continue to weigh on DZ Bank. One of the issues for potential buyers would be the cost of refinancing the shipping loans in the future. While DVB benefits from DZ Bank's AA minus rating, it would probably be downgraded significantly as a standalone business, according to finance sources. ""Segments of the shipping portfolio have been touted for consideration in the past. There are some toxic loans in there, so they may have to take a huge hit to get rid of it"" another source said. The global shipping sector is coming out of near decade long downturn caused by an over-ordering of ships and weaker demand. German banks were among the biggest players in shipping finance before being saddled with tens of billions of dollars in loans that became toxic and sources say much of this debt is unlikely to be recouped in full.

50,2018-05-04,Tunisia to Hold 1st Local Election Since 2011 Arab Spring,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/world/middleeast/ap-ml-tunisia-elections.html,538," TUNIS, Tunisia —  Tunisia is hoping to break through barriers with its first local election since its 2011 Arab Spring revolution — a vote that could produce the first female mayor of the capital, the first Jewish official with an Islamist party and new flock of mayors with greater powers. The North African country is trying to consolidate its young democracy with Sunday's election, in which Tunisia's 5.3 million voters will choose local leadership from 2,000 lists of candidates. The top vote-getters are expected to come from the Islamist Ennahdha party and the president's moderate secular Nida Tunis party, which govern together in a coalition. But nearly half the candidate lists are from independent groups that are pledging to address local issues. Other candidates are focusing on voters frustrated by political elites and successive governments that many feel have failed to live up to promises of the 2011 revolution, which unleashed uprisings around the Arab world. Tunisia has gone through a rocky transition to a democratic system seen as exceptional in a region dominated by authoritarian leaders. More than half of the candidates in the local elections are under 35 and 49 percent are women, a rarity in the Arab world. Eighteen lists are led by disabled candidates. Among the most prominent candidates is Souad Abderrahim,  a woman seeking to become the next mayor of Tunis. A pharmacist, former lawmaker and feminist activist, she is an independent who considers herself close to the Islamist party, and is running against 10 men in Sunday's most important race. Abderrahim, who does not wear a headscarf, calls her candidacy ""a source of pride for Tunisia women."" Tunisia has long been considered among the most liberal Muslim countries in terms of women's rights, but traditional views remain strong in some quarters and Islamic fundamentalism has resurfaced since the revolution. ""My conviction is that Tunisia is for everyone, and the constitution explains that Tunisians are equal in rights and responsibilities, independent of their sex, religion or color,"" Abderrahim told The Associated Press. She is pledging to put soap in every school bathroom to improve public health, make day care more accessible, plant more trees and revitalize the city's UNESCO-recognized cultural heritage sites such as the walled old town of Tunis, the Medina. Another unusual candidate is Simon Slama, a Jew from the town of Monastir running with Islamist party Ennahdha who has stressed the importance of Tunisia's tolerance and cultural diversity. The elections are seen as an important step in decentralizing power beyond the capital Tunis and handing more powers to town councils across the country, from Mediterranean beach resorts to struggling desert towns. The results are expected to suggest where the country is heading politically ahead of presidential and legislative elections next year. For the first time, security forces took part in the vote. In the past, Tunisia's leaders considered it dangerous for police and soldiers to take political positions but the change is part of Tunisia's democratic shift. The media were not allowed to cover their voting, which took place a week ahead of time, to ensure their political views were not publicly known. Electoral authorities organized get-out-the-vote efforts focusing on Tunisia's young people, whose high unemployment rates have fueled disillusionment."
51,2018-05-04,Flipkart Yet to Finalize Stake Sale Deal With Walmart-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-flipkart-m-a-walmart-talks.html,625," MUMBAI/BENGALURU/NEW DELHI —  Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart's board is yet to finalize a deal to sell a controlling stake to Walmart Inc, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, adding a deal could just be days away. Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified  sources, that Flipkart's board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion. A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart's board had ""in-principle"" approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved. The first two sources said Alphabet Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan's SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said. ""SoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,"" one of the sources said. Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion. Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show. Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment. AMAZON OFFER Earlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer. Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart's biggest rival in India. Amazon's move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers. Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said. Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country's antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested ""innovations or remedies."" ""This definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,"" he added. Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm. Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India's online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester. Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.

52,2018-05-04,Shares in Transport Firm Ceva Logistics Drop in Swiss Debut,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-ceva-logistics-ipo.html,327," ZURICH —  Shares in transport group Ceva Logistics fell more than 8 percent on their Swiss market debut on Friday as even pricing at the bottom end of its share offer range failed to spur demand in Switzerland's biggest IPO this year. Owned by private equity firm Apollo, Ceva Logistics raised 1.2 billion Swiss francs (886 million pounds) in an offering of new shares that included CMA CGM Group taking a roughly 25 percent stake. By mid-session, the stock was down 8.1 percent from the offer price of 27.50 francs per share. One market participant said the stock was too expensive compared with listed Swiss peers like Kuehne+Nagel and  Panalpina. Turbulent markets have put the brakes on deals and listings, with several scrapped IPOs - including those of Chinese conglomerate HNA Group's Gategroup and Swissport in Switzerland - costing bankers money in recent months. ""Investors can take their pick given the large number of European IPOs,"" one banker said. ""They have hardly made any money from IPOs of late so they are taking a very close look in the meantime."" Newcomers like Deutsche Bank's funds unit DWS and Bavarian drugmaker Dermapharm are trading below their issue prices. The next test of sentiment comes with next week's listing of scientific publisher Springer Nature, which plans to raise up to 1.6 billion euros (1.4 billion pounds). In Switzerland, the next big deal could be for packing group SIG, which sources say plans an IPO in the second half. Antibiotics group Polyphor starts trading in Switzerland on May 15 in a deal meeting relatively brisk demand. Ceva Logistics, whose clients include Ikea, Amazon and Volkswagen, is using proceeds from its share sale to reduce debt. One person familiar with the situation said around of a quarter of the shares sold went to hedge funds and the rest mostly to institutional investors. Interest was slight from Swiss investors, especially retail, another source said. (Writing by Michael Shields; Editing by Mark Potter)"

Trump says on Twitter Friday: ""NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite 'sources' which are constantly wrong."" Trump tweeted: ""the sources probably don't exist, they are fabricated, fiction! NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!"" NBC News attributed its story Thursday to two anonymous sources with knowledge of legal proceedings against Cohen. In its correction, the network said it subsequently learned that the feds were only monitoring the source of calls and weren't listening in. Trump has frequently criticized the media for ""fake news"" involving stories he doesn't like."
54,2018-05-04,Warren Buffett Really Likes Apple’s Shares: DealBook Briefing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/business/dealbook/jay-z-sec.html,2043," Good Friday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Berkshire continues to snap up Apple shares. • Unemployment rate falls below 4 percent. • Xerox’s C.E.O. and Board are staying put. • What the Beijing trade talks have achieved so far. • Jay-Z hasn’t responded to subpoenas from the S.E.C. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. Shares of Apple hit an all-time high Friday after Warren Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway had added significantly to its Apple holding during the first quarter. “We bought quite a bit more Apple in the first quarter,” Mr. Buffett said on CNBC. He then added: “It went up about 75 million shares.” Berkshire owned 165.3 million shares of Apple worth about $28 billion at the end of 2017. The new purchases would increase the value of Berkshire’s Apple holding, already its largest, to about $42 billion. “It is an unbelievable company,” Mr. Buffett said. “If you look at Apple, I think it earns almost twice as much as the second most profitable company in the United States. It is a wide, wide gap.” Here’s a look at how Wall Street economists are reacting to April’s jobs report: The economists at BofA Merrill Lynch: “While the April employment report was somewhat disappointing, it should continue to keep the Fed on track to raise rates in June. Job growth remains above breakeven levels and the unemployment rate edged down further, which should support the Fed’s expectation for wage growth to trend higher, albeit gradually. Strong inflation data had been worrying both the stock and bond markets, but today’s somewhat tepid wage growth number should ease those concerns, keeping the FOMC on its current plans to adjust the path of policy in a measured manner.” Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Shepherdson points out that the fall in the unemployment rate was because of a decline in the labor force, but “this won’t last, and as household employment catches up, unemployment will fall further. April’s 3.9% rate was the lowest since Dec 2000, and unemployment hasn’t been below 3.8 percent since 1969.” Mr. Sherpherdson adds that the wage growth still looks “benign,” but all the risks to wage growth are to the “upside” in the second half of 2018. Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US: “The U.S. labor market has tightened to the point where firms are simply having tremendous difficulty finding qualified and available workers which is why the American unemployment rate has declined to 3.9 percent and likely on its way to 3.7 percent later this year. Once the late cycle fiscal boost that is in train into the economy in the second half of 2018, there is a significant risk that the unemployment rate will decline at a much faster pace which will present a problem for the Federal Reserve that will likely want to tighten rates a modestly quicker pace even as the US yield curve flattens.” Tendayi Kapfidze, LendingTree: Mr. Kapfidze writes that disappointing wage growth suggests that “inflation pressures are not building up in the economy. The outlook for rates is heavily dependent on expectations for inflation which in term are influenced by wages.” The U.S. labor market remained strong last month, with the unemployment rate falling below 4 percent for the first time since 2000. April marked the 91st consecutive month of job gains, far and away the longest streak of increases on record. And the jobless rate is reaching historically low levels. In the last 60 years, there has been only one sustained period where unemployment stayed below 4 percent: the late 1960s. Here are the numbers • 164,000 jobs were added last month. Wall Street economists had expected an increase of about 193,000, according to Bloomberg. • The unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, the lowest rate since 2000 and a sign that the job market has become even more competitive. It had been 4.1 percent since October. • The Labor Department revised the job figures for February slightly downward, but revised the numbers for March sharply upward. The result was a net increase of 30,000 jobs, compared with previous estimates. • Average earnings rose by 4 cents an hour last month and are up 2.6 percent over the past year. The man born Shawn Carter hasn’t responded to subpoenas from the S.E.C. tied to its investigation of Iconix Brand Group. Iconix bought Rocawear, which he co-founded, for $200 million. Why the S.E.C. is interested, according to its statement: The S.E.C. said Mr. Carter wasn’t suspected of wrongdoing. A spokeswoman said he had nothing to do with the case and shouldn’t have to appear. It’s becoming one of corporate America’s strangest sagas: Xerox said last night that, contrary to the terms of the settlement it reached on Tuesday with the activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, its C.E.O. and board are staying put. Some explanation: • Xerox says the settlement expired last night, after Mr. Deason missed a deadline to withdraw a lawsuit. • Mr. Icahn and Mr. Deason say the board had demanded “unprecedented” legal protections. What’s next: Fujifilm will want Xerox to continue pursuing their deal. Mr. Icahn and Mr. Deason will keep fighting the board — and also Fujifilm, as “an aider and abettor” of what they argue to be breaches of fiduciary duty. Not much in terms of solid plans. The U.S. delegation reiterated demands like a $200 billion cut in the trade deficit with China, which Beijing deemed “unfair.” We’ve written before about the splits in the U.S. delegation between free-traders like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and hard-liners like the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer. But China’s negotiators face their own problem: They’re superqualified on economics, less so on trade law. A sign that relations haven’t completely frozen over: Beijing approved Qualcomm’s plans for a Chinese joint venture on smartphone chips. (Still no word on the NXP takeover.) And UBS is seeking control of its Chinese joint venture. Elsewhere in trade: A congressional race in Boeing’s home district is suddenly a tossup. How tariffs are reshaping the solar industry, including by spurring M.&A. • Rudy Giuliani’s disclosures might have been aimed at solving a legal problem for President Trump, but they may have created several others.

55,2018-05-04,"UK Oil Terminal Closure Delays Brent Cargoes in May, June-Sources",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-northsea-oil-brent.html,295," LONDON —  North Sea Brent crude cargoes for loading in May and June have been delayed due to the shutdown at the UK's Sullom Voe oil terminal, trade sources said on Friday, slowing supply of the crude which helps underpin a global pricing benchmark. The Brent stream was originally scheduled to load almost 100,000 barrels per day of crude in May and is usually the smallest of five crude grades that underpin the Brent benchmark, which is used to set prices worldwide. Enquest, Sullom Voe's operator, said on Thursday it spotted a ""minor defect"" during a routine inspection and shut the Brent and Ninian crude pipelines which bring crude to the terminal from North Sea fields. All of the four 600,000-barrel Brent cargoes originally planned to load in June have had their loading dates delayed by at least four to five days, a trade source said. In addition, oil trading sources said on Thursday one of the five Brent cargoes due to load in May had been dropped from the loading schedule and another was delayed into June. Sullom Voe is also the outlet for a smaller North Sea crude stream, Clair, and planned maintenance has already reduced production of this grade, another trade source said, although one cargo may load this month. The terminal is still expected to reopen on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter said. An Enquest spokesperson did not have a further update on Friday. The incident follows unplanned outages of another crude grade underpinning the Brent benchmark, Forties, earlier this year and in 2017. The outage of Forties, about four times the size of Brent, helped boost world prices. TAQA, the Brent pipeline operator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

56,2018-05-04,Trump: NK Summit Plans Set; US Troop Drawdown Not on Table,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/politics/ap-us-trump-korea.html,814," WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump offered his latest teaser Friday for a historic U.S. summit with North Korea: The time and place have been set but he's not saying when and where. The White House did, however, announce the details of a separate meeting later this month between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as the U.S. administration pushed back on a report that Trump is considering the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the allied nation. Trump and Moon would meet at the White House on May 22 to ""continue their close coordination on developments regarding the Korean Peninsula"" following last Friday's meeting between Moon and Kim Jong Un. They will also discuss the U.S. president's own upcoming summit with the North Korean leader, a statement said. Earlier this week, Trump expressed a preference for holding the ""big event"" with Kim in the demilitarized zone or DMZ between the two Koreas, where Moon and Kim met. He also said Singapore was in contention to host what will be the first summit of between a U.S. and a North Korean leader. ""We now have a date and we have a location. We'll be announcing it soon,"" Trump told reporters Friday from the White House South Lawn before departing for Dallas. He's previously said the summit was planned for May or early June. A meeting with Kim seemed an outlandish possibility just a few months ago when the two leaders were trading threats and insults over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. But momentum for diplomacy has built this year as the rival Koreas have patched up ties. In March, Trump unexpectedly accepted an offer of talks from Kim after the North Korean dictator agreed to suspend nuclear and ballistic missile tests and discuss ""denuclearization."" According to South Korea, Kim has said he'd be willing to give up his nukes if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and pledges not to attack the North. But his exact demands for relinquishing weapons that his nation spent decades building remains unclear. Trump said that withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea is ""not on the table."" Some 28,500 U.S. forces are based in the allied nation, a military presence that has been preserved to deter North Korea since the war ended in 1953 without a peace treaty. ""Now I have to tell you, at some point into the future, I would like to save the money,"" Trump said later as he prepared to board Air Force One. ""You know we have 32,000 troops there but I think a lot of great things will happen but troops are not on the table. Absolutely."" The New York Times reported that Trump has asked the Pentagon to prepare options plans for drawing down American troops. It cited unnamed officials as saying that wasn't intended to be a bargaining chip with Kim, but did reflect that a prospective peace treaty between the Koreas could diminish the need for U.S. forces in South Korea. At the inter-Korean summit last Friday, held on the southern side of the DMZ, Moon and Kim pledged to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons and seek a formal end this year to the Korean conflict where the opposing sides remain technically at war more than six decades after fighting halted with an armistice. But for Trump to contemplate withdrawing troops now would be a quixotic move as he enters into negotiations with Kim whose demands and intentions are uncertain. Two weeks ago, shortly before the inter-Korean summit, Moon said that Kim actually wasn't insisting on a longstanding demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as a precondition for abandoning his nukes. National security adviser John Bolton, who met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong in Washington on Friday, called the Times report ""utter nonsense."" During his presidential campaign, Trump complained that South Korea does not do enough to financially support the American military commitment. In March, Washington and Seoul began negotiations on how much South Korea should offset the costs of the deployment in the coming years. Under the current agreement that expires at the end of 2018, the South provides about $830 million per year. Before Trump meets Kim, Washington is looking for North Korea to address another persistent source of tension between the adversaries: the detention of three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state of activities in the North. Trump hinted that the release of Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim was in the offing, but again was sparing on the details. ""We're having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages, and I think you're going to see very good things. As I said yesterday, stay tuned,"" Trump said, referring to an earlier tweet on the issue. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report."
57,2018-05-04,Chemical Weapons Inspectors Back From Syria's Douma: Source,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-mideast-crisis-syria-chemicalweapons.html,423," AMSTERDAM —  Chemical weapons inspectors have returned from a mission to the Syrian town of Douma, where they took samples and interviewed witnesses to determine whether banned munitions were used in an attack last month, a diplomatic source said on Friday. A team of experts from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons returned to the Netherlands on Thursday night after going to Damascus on April 14, the source said on condition of anonymity. The suspected chemical attack prompted missile strikes by the United States, France and Britain on April 13 against several alleged chemical weapons facilities in Syria. The OPCW is investigating the deaths of dozens of people in Douma, an enclave in Ghouta on the oustskrts of the Syrian capital, on April 7. The United States and its allies say they were caused by chemical weapons, possibly a nerve agent, used by forces of the Russian-back government of President Bashar al-Assad. Inspectors visited two sites of alleged attacks and took samples, which will be split at their laboratory in the Netherlands before being forwarded to affiliated national labs for testing. Test results are typically returned within three to four weeks. The OPCW will not assign blame. The inspectors were also expected to have taken samples from canisters found at the scene that are believed to have contained toxic agents dropped from airplanes or helicopters. Russia and Syria last week held a briefing for states belonging to the OPCW to support Moscow's assertion that no chemical weapons were used in Douma and the attack was staged by rebels. The briefing was boycotted by several OPCW member states, who denounced the Russian event as ""a crude propaganda exercise"" intended to undermine the OPCW's work. Britain, the United States, France, Germany and others, said in a statement that all material gathered so far supported their theory that chemical weapons were used in Douma. The information gathered to date is ""unassailable,"" they said at the time. Medical NGOs having found traces of chemical agents and authenticated photo and video evidence reinforces the theory of gas intoxication by hundreds of victims. The World Health Organization has also expressed concern ""at reports from its partners of patients exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals.” A joint United Nations-OPCW investigation concluded last year that Syrian government forces used sarin nerve agent and chlorine in several attacks. The joint mission ended in November after Russia repeatedly  blocked U.N. Security Council resolutions that would have extended its mandate. (Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Angus MacSwan)"
58,2018-05-04,Czechs Tested Novichok-Like Substance for Chemical Warfare Protection: Government,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-britain-russia-skripal-czech.html,395," PRAGUE —  Nerve agents of the Novichok type though not the same as that used to poison a former Russian spy in Britain have been synthesized in tiny amounts in the Czech Republic to help train the army against chemical warfare, the government said. The Czech Republic had been listed among others by Russia as potential source of the Novichok-like substance that left ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in critical condition in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. The Czech Defense Ministry said that it had carried out ""microsynthesis"" of several micrograms at a time of potential chemical warfare agents, including Novichok and sarin gas. This did not amount to production as understood under international treaty and could not have leaked, it said. ""Substances referred to as 'Novichok' in the press, among them the A230 substance, are potential poisonous chemical substances, whose identification ... is part of the training of Czech anti-chemical military units,"" a ministry statement said. ""The tested substance originates in a tube solely for the purpose of measuring spectral data and the content is always immediately destroyed after testing, in line with regulations and the Czech Republic's commitments,"" it said. ""The probability of a leak, therefore, equals zero."" The Foreign Ministry said separately that the A230 type tested in the Czech Republic was different from the substance known as A234 that had been used in the Skripal assault. The Czech government said earlier the substance used in Skripal's poisoning could not have come from the Czech Republic. Britain accused Russia of being behind the March 4 attack on the Skripals. Moscow has denied any involvement. The New York Times quoted Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as saying on Thursday that about 50 to 100 grams of liquid nerve agent were used in the Skripal poisoning. That would be significantly larger amount than what would be created in a laboratory for research purposes, Uzumcu said. Information on the Czech testing was requested by President Milos Zeman, who has repeatedly taken pro-Russian positions on international issues such as the war in Ukraine and EU sanctions against Moscow. The Czech government, which is in charge of foreign policy, expelled three Russian diplomats as part of the European response to the attacks on the Skripals.

60,2018-05-04,Blackstone's F&R Acquisition to Close in Late Summer,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-thomsonreuters-loan.html,538," LONDON (LPC) - US private equity firm Blackstone Group’s US$20bn (15 billion pounds) acquisition of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk (F&R) unit is expected to close in late summer as regulatory requirements make a targeted July 1 completion look increasingly unlikely, sources familiar with the matter said. The acquisition is expected to close in September, most likely at the end of the month, which is also the end of the third quarter, several sources said. ""It is likely to slip to September. It is easier to close at the end of the quarter when the numbers come through,” a senior source said. A deadline of the end of July has been set for EU approvals and the deal could close earlier if it gets swift regulatory approval, the sources said. Thomson Reuters said on May 2 that the acquisition is expected to close in the second half of the year and is subject to specified regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The company will report its first-quarter earnings on May 11, 2018. Blackstone announced on January 30 that it is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR. A US$13.5bn-equivalent loan and bond financing backing the acquisition is expected to launch in early September, after the market reconvenes after the August summer holiday. “The debt deal will come in early September. They will get back from holiday, do a roadshow then launch,” the senior source said. The deal, which is being led by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, is the biggest buyout financing since the financial crisis. A post-summer syndication will leave the underwriting banks on risk over the holiday period, something which is becoming more common as large cross-border acquisitions run into increasingly lengthy regulatory approval processes. The three lead banks reduced their risk when 21 senior banks were signed into the deal in March and underwrote 28% of the transaction. Invitations to participate in the deal at this level were linked to the amount of business that banks do with Thomson Reuters. Blackstone was able to command favourable financing terms when the deal was put in place before a period of increased market volatility in February, but step ups in market flex terms and debt caps have been included to give banks additional protection, several market sources said. Thomson Reuters declined to comment. JP Morgan, Citigroup and BoAML declined to comment. Blackstone was not immediately available to comment. DEAL STRUCTURE The debt financing includes a US$8bn-equivalent term loan B, which is split between US$5.5bn and US$2.5bn-equivalent in euros. The financing also includes US$3bn-equivalent of secured bonds split between US$2bn and US$1bn-equivalent in euros, and US$2.5bn-equivalent of unsecured bonds split between US$1.8bn and US$700m-equivalent in euros. The company will also place a US$750m revolving credit facility. Additional funding comes from US$1bn in preferred equity – with a 14.5% Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – US$3bn of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and US$2.5bn of existing equity, based on the US$20bn valuation, that will be rolled over. The currency splits may change depending on investor demand and the timing of the wider institutional syndication.

62,2018-05-04,"For Tanztheater Wuppertal, Life After Pina Includes New Works",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/dance/pina-bausch-commissions-tanztheater-wuppertal.html,1523," WUPPERTAL, Germany — It has been 45 years since anyone but Pina Bausch has made a full-length work for the Tanztheater Wuppertal. “Half a century — just think about that,” said Adolphe Binder, the new(ish) director of the company, as she surveyed a slightly chaotic rehearsal scene at the Schauspielhaus, a municipal theater here. “Actually, I don’t want to think about it!” Ms. Binder, 49, is the fourth director to run the Tanztheater Wuppertal since Bausch’s sudden death in 2009. Since then, and despite predictions that the company could fold without Bausch’s vital presence, the troupe has staunchly, and to great acclaim, continued to perform the phantasmagorical, epic pieces that gave the world a new performance genre: dance-theater. Now, a fresh era is about to dawn for the company. On May 12, a new piece by the Greek choreographer Dimitris Papaioannou will open at the Wuppertal opera house, followed by another premiere, on June 2, from the Norwegian choreographer Alan Lucien Oyen. Both men were chosen by Ms. Binder, the former director of the GöteborgsOperans Danskompani, who took up the reins here last May. She isn’t the first to think that the company should create new work. Dominic Mercy and Robert Sturm, the team that took over after Bausch’s death, mooted the idea early on, but it proved too problematic at the time. “Which choreographer could you bring here after Pina?” the Australian Bausch dancer Julie Shanahan asked in 2010. But times have changed. In 2015, the company worked with four young choreographers to create short pieces that were presented in Wuppertal. Now, the full-length commissions (as yet unnamed) from Mr. Papaioannou and Mr. Oyen will join the Bausch repertory and be presented internationally over the next year. “We’ve come 10 years along the road, and we’ve found we have so much knowledge in us, and a lot of new energy,” Ms. Shanahan said in a telephone interview. Reminded of her earlier statement, she said that back then, the period immediately after Bausch’s death, the company was shocked and exhausted. “The decision to find a choreographer was incredibly heavy, because we were in mourning. Our whole life had been dedicated to this one person, and now we had this massive repertoire and no vision of the future.” What happens after the death of a choreographer who is a company’s sole creative source, is a continuing dance-world preoccupation. Unlike the Merce Cunningham, who drew up a plan for the closure of his company and maintenance of his work after his death; or the Paul Taylor Company, which has diversified into broader repertory while Mr. Taylor is still in charge, Bausch and her associates had made no plans for what would happen to her body of work or the company she had directed since 1973. Ms. Binder said that when she was approached for the job — she succeeded a former Bausch dancer, Lutz Förster — the search committee was clear that new work was on the agenda. “But if you are the one chosen to transform or change things, it comes with some suspicion as well,” she said. “It’s not an easy process for anyone.” For new works, she said, she wanted choreographers who would connect to the DNA of the company and the spirit of Bausch, without necessarily copying her distinctive style with its dreamscapes of social rituals and private obsessions. “I was looking for people who are not in the classical sense choreographers, but who can explore what dance-theater means in the 21st century,” she said. “People who were not bound to one genre, but who embraced other genres like painting, filmmaking, theater, philosophy.” “My first response was: ‘Oh, come on!’ ” said Mr. Papaioannou, 53, who achieved a measure of fame after staging the opening and closing ceremonies of the Athens Olympics in 2004. “But I soon realized that if life gives me that chance, and I didn’t take it, I would be on my deathbed saying: ‘Why did you say no?’ ” Mr. Papaioannou makes large-scale, slow-paced, intensely visual works that draw from both Robert Wilson’s exquisitely stylized theatricality and Bausch’s sense of the absurd, layered with his own stark aesthetic and preoccupations — myth, religion, the human body. He trained as a visual artist and began to dance while at college; then he designed costumes, sets and lighting, in addition to performing. “At no point was there a conscious decision about dance,” he said in an interview before a morning rehearsal. “I was intrigued and started doing my own thing — and 30 years passed.” Mr. Papaioannou said he usually takes about five months to create a work but agreed to a much shorter period in Wuppertal. How had that been? “Terrible,” he said soberly. “It’s a nightmare for me. But I knew that.” His process is clearly painstaking. At an evening rehearsal, wearing black shorts, a T-shirt and orange trainers, he sat on the floor, wrapping huge sheets of paper around his legs and scrutinizing the effect, while dancers tried walking up and down a hill of black foam steps behind him. “Chaos has finished,” he announced when he was satisfied with the paper (which turned out to be a plastic fabric more practical for long-term use). “Wind, please!” A wind machine began to blow across the body and hair of a woman crouched at the top of the hill, and a man’s naked body emerged from a crevice in the foam. “No, no,” Mr. Papaioannou called out, “it’s too dramatic — it’s a Greek drama!” His team laughed. As the rehearsal proceeded, Mr. Papaioannou several times told the dancers to do less, move less. “He is very visual, very precise, very sensitive to timing and interested in how materials respond to movement,” said Barbara Kaufmann, a veteran Bausch dancer who is the rehearsal director for Mr. Papaioannou’s piece. Scott Jennings, a British dancer who joined the company in 2012, said that the performers have had to shift away from using feelings or emotions to animate movement, as they do in Bausch’s work. “With Dimitris, you are trying endlessly to make images work, make illusions work, put your body in space in a super-detailed way,” he said. “Each person is so important for the big picture.” The experience, he said, had meant getting to know his colleagues in a different way. “For all of us who came after Pina, we’ve been going into something that exists and others know the journey of those pieces. It’s lovely to start on a blank page with everyone.” There was, Mr. Jennings added, much positive energy in the company that wasn’t there when he joined. “Even five or six years ago, the idea of new work would have been taken differently,” he said. “I think it was a feeling of stepping into an unknown place, and perhaps some fear about that.” That fear worried for Mr. Oyen, 40, who is an artist in residence at the Norwegian National Ballet and also runs his own theater group, Winter Guests. “One of my concerns was: W ill they want this?” he said in a telephone interview. But, he said, he realized that “if it was terrifying for me, it must have been more so for them. Some of them have only ever worked with Pina, and they must feel, that’s all I know. It’s brave of them, too.” Beginning a weeklong workshop with the dancers last June in the Lichtburg — a former cinema that the Tanztheater Wuppertal has used for rehearsals since 1981 — was, he said, “like stepping into a temple. I felt that history was in the air, all these stories that had been lived in this room. And I felt constantly that there was an empty seat there.” Mr. Oyen asked the dancers just to “talk and get to know each other.” There was a bit of skepticism, he said, but they slowly opened up, sharing stories of how they came to the company. “It felt like uncorking something; it was emotional,” he said. “If they weren’t eager to create before, they are now I think.” That encounter with the dancers is reminiscent of Bausch’s creative process, in which she asked the dancers questions about their lives and experiences, then wove the material into a potent mix of drama and dream. Mr. Oyen agreed that his process was probably similar. “I didn’t know so much how she created when I came,” he said. He now realizes how much she has influenced him without him being aware “because she had such an enormous influence not just on dance but on contemporary theater.” Azusa Seyama, who joined the company in 2000, said that for the Bausch-era dancers, who still number around half of the 35 dancers in the company, the experience of working with the Mr. Oyen and Mr. Papaioannou was “an opportunity to learn something which we didn’t learn with Pina.” The stakes for the company, and for Ms. Binder, are nonetheless high. As Mr. Oyen put it: “It will be interesting to see whether the world is ready to see Tanztheater Wuppertal dance something that is not by Pina Bausch.”"

Europe's biggest insurer says it's also set itself a goal of phasing out investments in coal companies and increasing its use of renewable energy by 2040. Munich-based Allianz said Friday it wants to make the 2015 Paris climate accord's goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius a target in all of its business activities. The company, which manages investments totaling some 2 trillion euros ($2.4 trillion), pledged three years ago to stop investing in companies whose coal activities make up over 30 percent of their revenue. The burning of coal for electricity and heat is a major source of carbon emissions that contribute to the greenhouse effect."
64,2018-05-04,U.S. Prison Officials Rescind Policy Restricting Books Behind Bars,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/us/04reuters-usa-prisons-books.html,400," WASHINGTON —  U.S. prison officials have rescinded a controversial new policy that would have made it harder and more expensive for federal inmates to receive books by banning direct delivery from publishers, book clubs and bookstores. The Bureau of Prisons policy would have imposed a seven-step process with a 30 percent price markup and would have allowed purchases only through a private vendor, according to a copy of a memo by a Florida prison warden. After the move prompted concern from inmates' families and prison reform advocates, the agency said on Thursday that the proposed restrictions had been part of efforts to curb contraband from entering the 122 federal prisons. The memos have been rescinded and are under review ""to ensure we strike the right balance between maintaining the safety and security of our institutions and inmate access to correspondence and reading materials,"" the prisons bureau said in an email. The decision to pull the restrictions followed a grilling by Democratic lawmakers of the bureau's director, Mark Inch, during a House of Representatives Judiciary subcommittee hearing in April. Asked about the Florida prison memo, Inch said he was not aware of the policy but that inmates still had access to books in prison libraries. ""I will certainly communicate if there's a misperception that we are withholding educational and recreational books of any form, because that is certainly not the case,"" he said. Under a 2011 policy, the roughly 183,000 federal prisoners can receive books from a publisher, book club, or bookstore. Inmates at minimum-security prisons can also get paperback books from any source, including family and friends. At Florida's Coleman prison, the restrictions were to have taken effect on May 14 and would have mandated that prisoners file an electronic request including the 13-digit International Standard Book Number, according to the March 29 memo by the warden. The memo was made available to Reuters by Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a Washington advocacy group. The Bureau of Prisons did not respond to a query about how many prisons had already adopted the books policy, nor to identify the private vendor or explain the reason for the price markup. In January New York state prison officials began sharply limiting the books and packages that could be mailed to state prisoners. Governor Andrew Cuomo canceled the policy after an outcry from inmates' families and prison reform advocates. (Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Susan Thoma)"

Employment in manufacturing grew by 24,000. Much of the growth stemmed from makers of durable goods, like machinery and fabricated metal products. Over the past year, that sector has added 245,000 jobs, with durable goods accounting for about three-fourths of the increase. Professional services added 54,000 jobs last month, driven by positions in computer systems, temporary help and building services. The sector has been the strongest performer over the past 12 months, having added more than a half-million jobs. Health care also registered a solid month of hiring, with more than 24,000 added jobs at physicians' offices, dental clinics and home health care. Overall, U.S. employers added 164,000 jobs in April, up from an upwardly revised 135,000 in March, the Labor Department said Friday. "

Germany's largest lender, under new Chief Executive Christian Sewing, called time last week on its strategy of being a global investment bank, a move expected to lead to a cut of around 10 percent of its U.S. workforce. An internal memo from Mark Fedorcik, co-head of corporate and investment banking in the Americas, said while the bank was committed to the other economic areas covered by its U.S. investment bank, including financial services and healthcare, it wanted to focus on sectors in which it had the greatest strength. ""We have decided to rationalise our U.S. oil and gas investment banking coverage footprint which will include closing our Houston office,"" the memo said. The move would likely affect around 50 people employed in covering oil and gas, according to a source familiar with the matter. Deutsche Bank would continue to service U.S. oil and gas clients seeking debt capital markets and corporate banking treasury products. Its power and utilities business would be moved into its industrials group, the memo added. (Reporting by David French; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

The National Communication Council said it had suspended the international media organizations for six months, accusing them of breaching press laws and unprofessional conduct. The regulator said in a statement the BBC had invited a  Burundi national on its program whose remarks were ""inappropriate, exaggerated, non-verified, damaging the reputation of the head of state, to ethnic hatred, to political conflict and civil disobedience."" VOA was suspended for broadcasting on a frequency banned by the regulator, according to the statement. The French broadcaster Radio France International and the local station Isanganiro were also cited in the statement and warned about employing more rigorous verification of sources. VOA said it was dismayed by the ban but that its content will continue to be available in Kirundi and Kinyarwanda via shortwave channels, on the Internet and on FM transmitters located in neighboring countries. “Our audience members count on VOA to provide factual, unbiased and objective coverage of current events, so this ban deprives the citizens of Burundi of a trusted news source during a critical time in that country,"" VOA Director Amanda Bennett said in a statement. There was no immediate comment from the BBC. ""This falls in line with the repression in Burundi as we head closer to the referendum,"" said Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher in the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. ""The banning of two major sources of information for the Burundian people is worrying. ""This is happening in the context of journalists getting threatened, those reporting on some of the oppression are being muzzled."" Burundi ranks 159th out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index compiled by the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, which says ""journalists find it hard to work freely and are often harassed by security forces."" The country is scheduled to hold a referendum on May 17 that would extend the presidential term to seven years from five. If the measure passes, President Pierre Nkurunziza, now 54 years old, would be free to run for office again in 2020. The amendment would limit the president to two consecutive seven-year terms, but it would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza's rule to 2034. ""Conditions for holding a credible referendum deteriorate as days go by ... the regime is now afraid of the media's force, which can derail their plan for the upcoming referendum and the 2020 elections,"" said Léonce Ngendakumana, deputy chairman of the opposition party FRODEBU, the Front for Democracy in Burundi. On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department condemned recent political violence in Burundi and expressed concern that the vote could hurt the country's institutions. Human rights groups say they do not think the vote will take place in a free and fair climate. Nearly 430,000 people, including opposition politicians, have fled the East African nation of 10.5 million people since Nkurunziza won a third term in a 2015 election that led to violent clashes. His foes said he had no right to run again. (Writing by Omar Mohammed, editing by Larry King)"
68,2018-05-04,Black Unemployment Rate Hit Record Low in April,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/politics/ap-us-economy-jobs-report-demographics-glance.html,286," WASHINGTON —  The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to a record low in April, though not necessarily for positive reasons. The jobless rate for African-Americans reached 6.6 percent, the lowest level on Labor Department records dating to 1972. Though some of them found work, many others stopped looking for a job and so weren't categorized as unemployed. The government counts people as unemployed only if they're actively looking for work. When fewer people seek a job, the unemployment rate often declines. Though it has improved in recent years, the unemployment rate for African-Americans remains stubbornly higher than the rates for other racial and ethnic groups. Among age groups, the jobless rate for teenagers fell from to 12.9 percent, the lowest level since 2000. All told, employers added 164,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent, the lowest level since December 2000. The data for demographic groups came from a survey of households that is part of the Labor Department's monthly jobs report. "
69,2018-05-04,University Reviewing Grant Funds for Greitens' Book,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/ap-us-missouri-governor-book-grant.html,855," JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. —  A private university says it is looking into whether grant money was misused after a former political aide for embattled Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens said he got paid from grant funds to promote one of Greitens' books as he simultaneously helped launch Greitens' gubernatorial campaign. Washington University in St. Louis became aware of potential issues with the grant after the aide's testimony was released as part of a legislative investigation into various allegations against the Republican governor, who already is facing felony charges related to an extramarital affair and the misuse of charity resources for political purposes. ""As a grantee, we take accountability seriously. We are looking into the matter to ensure the funds were used appropriately,"" said Julie Flory, the university's assistant vice chancellor for campus communications. Greitens' spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday. A report released Wednesday by a legislative panel included testimony from former Greitens' aide Danny Laub, who said he was paid both by Greitens and a nonprofit grant in early 2015 to simultaneously promote Greitens' political aspirations and the release of his book ""Resilience."" The book's acknowledgment section states that it was ""generously supported"" by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation's Character and Virtue Development program. Washington University administered the grant for the foundation, which is based in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. The grant agreement for the Templeton Foundation specifically prohibits the use of funds ""to influence the outcome of any specific public election,"" Michael Murray, the foundation's senior vice president for programs, said Friday. Washington University's policies also prohibit grant funds from being used for campaign activities, Flory said. Federal law bars 501(c)(3) charities from intervening in political campaigns on behalf of candidates. Exactly how much Greitens and his aides were paid from the grant remains secret.  The Templeton Foundation and Washington University both declined to release a copy of the grant agreement to The Associated Press. Murray said the grant supporting Greitens' work was active in 2011 and 2012 but doesn't appear on the foundation's online database of grants, because the agreement with Washington University didn't allow information about it to be publicly shared. Murray said that's not necessarily unusual, though two other grants to Washington University are listed online. The intermingling of politics and Greitens' grant-funded book was one of a variety of ways in which Greitens was working to build his political credentials both before and after he officially formed a political fundraising committee in February 2015, according to testimony from his former aides. Greitens already faces a felony charge in St. Louis of tampering with computer data for disclosing a donor list from The Mission Continues to his political fundraiser in 2015 without the permission of the St. Louis-based veterans charity he founded. According to the Missouri House panel investigating Greitens, Laub testified that he was misled by another Greitens' campaign aide into becoming a fall guy when Greitens filed documents with the Missouri Ethics Commission falsely stating that Laub was the source of the charity donor list. Greitens also faces a May 14 trial in St. Louis on an invasion of privacy indictment alleging he took and transmitted a nonconsensual photo of an at least partially nude woman in 2015. Greitens has acknowledged having a consensual affair with the woman but denied criminal wrongdoing. The report released by the House says Laub began getting paid in December 2014 by The Greitens Group, which was Greitens' personal promotional company. He testified that his job was primarily related to Greitens impending 2016 campaign for governor and to promoting his upcoming book. The two purposes often overlapped, he said. In July 2014, before he was officially on the payroll, Laub prepared a document for Greitens proposing to conduct a ""Resilience"" book tour  focusing on Missouri's top 10 Republican primary counties to help build boost his political appeal. That particular tour never happened as planned, he said. But ""Leveraging the 'Resilience' book tour"" was back on the agenda during a December political meeting that involved Greitens, Laub and others. ""Eric was going to do a book tour, of seeing what finance events he could set up in other cities that coincided with the book tour,"" Laub said in a deposition taken by the Missouri attorney general's office and shared with the House investigatory committee. ""So when he was in New York or when he was in California and he was doing media hits, that he could also set up national donor meetings."" Laub testified that he and Greitens went to Washington, D.C., in January 2015 to meet with possible vendors for a political campaign, including one company that he said Greitens wanted to test out. ""The thought was to have them doing a little bit of work on his book tour to see how they performed,"" Laub said. Records discussed in the deposition indicate Laub received two checks of $3,250 from Washington University in early 2015 that were funded through the Templeton Foundation grant. Laub said he knew little about the details of the grant but understood that Greitens ""could spend freely on 'Resilience'-related things"" from the grant funds. ___"
70,2018-05-04,Swedish Academy to Reform After Controversy Postpones Nobel Prize,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/us/04reuters-nobel-prize-explainer.html,831," STOCKHOLM —  The Swedish Academy which decides the Nobel Prize for Literature said it would not make an award in 2018 and instead focus on internal reforms to restore its reputation in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment and information leaks. The scandals have threatened to undermine the credibility of the award and attracted unprecedented scrutiny of the Academy, a highly secretive body whose choices of prize winner fascinate and often baffle literature lovers the world over. Below are key elements of the controversy and its consequences. WHAT SPARKED THE CRISIS? At heart of the row are allegations of sexual assault and harassment made by several women against Jean-Claude Arnault, a photographer and well-known cultural figure in Sweden who is married to poet and Academy member Katarina Frostenson. He is also accused of leaking prize-winners' names ahead of their official announcement, a major cultural event which is covered each year by the world's media. Arnault denies all the allegations against him, including that of being the source of leaks, his lawyer said. State prosecutors are conducting a preliminary investigation of assault allegations against Arnault. Another such investigation, regarding alleged assaults dating between March 2013 and April 2015, was dropped last month due to a lack of evidence and because for some the statute of limitations had passed. The allegations made by 18 women against Arnault were first published in Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter in November. The same paper also reported that the Academy had carried out an internal investigation alleging that Arnault had leaked the closely-guarded names of Nobel prize winners on seven different occasions. The paper said these included Bob Dylan in 2016 as well as French author Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio in 2008 and British playwright Harold Pinter in 2005. The Swedish Academy last month acknowledged that names had been leaked though it did not specify which laureates this concerned nor who was the source of the leaks. WHY DID THE CONTROVERSY CAUSE A RIFT IN THE ACADEMY? After cutting ties with Arnault, the Academy held a vote on whether to exclude Frostenson from the body for allegedly breaching conflict of interest rules and divulging names of prize winners to her husband, who could then leak them. The motion failed, with Frostenson allowed to stay, prompting three of the Academy's 18 members to resign in protest. In the following weeks another three, including the Permanent Secretary of the Academy, Sara Danius and Frostenson herself, also withdrew. Eight Academy members said in an open letter to a newspaper that they had voted against excluding Frostenson on the grounds that the evidence, some of it from anonymous sources, was insufficient. Frostenson has so far not commented publicly on the vote and accusations against her. She did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. WHAT REFORMS ARE UNDERWAY? Sweden's king has stepped in to drive reforms of the Swedish Academy, established in 1786 by his forebear Gustav III and of which he is the formal patron. Appointments to the Academy have been for life and there has been no formal provision under the arcane rules for members to resign. That has meant those who withdrew could not be replaced. This week, King Carl XVI Gustaf revised the Swedish Academy's rules to allow members resign. The change also means that members who have not participated in the Academy's work for two years will be considered to have resigned. Other changes are likely in store. In connection with its decision to postpone the prize, the Swedish Academy said it had begun a wide-ranging project to alter the way it conducted its business while still seeking to respect its historic legacy. Besides the right to resign, procedures for handling conflicts of interest and secret information would be strengthened while its external communication would also be modernized, it said in a statement. ""The active members of the Swedish Academy are of course fully aware that the present crisis of confidence places high demands on a long-term and robust work for change,"" it said. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES? The Academy took the rare decision to postpone the 2018 Nobel literature prize to next year, meaning it will award two prizes in 2019. The prize has been postponed or canceled only a handful of times, for instance during World War Two. The most recent postponement was the award to American novelist William Faulkner, who received his 1949 prize a year late, in 1950. The biggest risk by far is to the reputation of the prize, which has come to be seen as one of the most important international honors in the field of literature. The Nobel Foundation, which administers the estate of dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, said the crisis at the Academy had ""adversely affected"" the Nobel Prize. ""Their decision underscores the seriousness of the situation and will help safeguard the long-term reputation of the Nobel Prize,"" the Foundation said in statement.

71,2018-05-04,China Horse Club Makes a Run for the Roses,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/sports/china-horse-club-kentucky-derby.html,1673," As American thoroughbred racing takes center stage under the famed Twin Spires of Churchill Downs this weekend, several horses in the spotlight will be bankrolled by a new and surprising source: China. In just five years, the exclusive and secretive China Horse Club has become a major global player in the so-called sport of kings. The club co-owns 10 prominent horses racing Friday and Saturday, including the Kentucky Derby favorite Justify; another Derby contender, Audible; the Oaks entrant Sassy Sienna; and last year’s Oaks winner, Abel Tasman. The emergence of the China Horse Club reflects the rise of partnerships across the industry to reduce risk by pooling capital and buying into proven horses. Nine of the 20 Derby horses are owned by partnerships, including eight of the top 10 horses in the point standings. “The Derby in America means everything, so we’re excited at the moment just to have a shot,” said Michael Wallace, the club’s racing and bloodstock manager. “If we could win it, that news would be spread far and wide through China, and it would be a massive feather in the cap for the club.” Gone are the days when bidding wars among the world’s racing elite produced big price tags at the sales, including a record $16 million in 2006 for The Green Monkey, who raced three times and finished no better than third. The China Horse Club has about 200 members, according to its vice president, Eden Harrington. Membership costs a minimum of $1 million, according to some reports, but Mr. Harrington said the club offered different tiers of investment and that the fee was a credit that went toward the purchase of horses. He declined to give a range, and the club does not disclose the identities of members, who include wealthy citizens from China’s mainland and beyond. The club’s success, however, has led to questions about where its money is coming from, how it is being used, and how the club has been able to spend so much overseas when the Chinese government’s sweeping anti-corruption crackdown has halted billions of dollars of international deals. Teo Ah Khing, the man behind the high-flying club, is a self-described billionaire from Malaysia with big ambitions. Mr. Teo, a Harvard-educated architect, does not want to just win races, he wants to build a horse racing mecca in China, where gambling is still illegal. He has also broken ground on a horse racing “resort and lifestyle development” in St. Lucia, a Caribbean island that currently has no thoroughbred industry but does have a citizenship-by-investment program that provides passports to anyone who invests $100,000 in the country — an attractive perk for wealthy Chinese citizens who want to escape pollution and seek better education for their children. Mr. Teo did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr. Teo’s introduction to the world of horse racing began when he designed the Meydan Racecourse in Dubai for Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. His club is now the world’s ninth-ranked owner, according to a calculation by the website Thoroughbred Racing Commentary. Mr. Harrington said the club kept its membership private to shield members from potential public scrutiny amid a Chinese government led anti-corruption campaign which has “created a culture of fear where people didn’t want to be seen to be spending money in a way that may be seen as excessive.” The club, he said, “took a stance to ensure that we would race under the banner of the club to protect our members to that end.” He added that the club has undertaken its own reviews to make sure members did not come by money illegally. Adding to the China Horse Club’s mystery, Mr. Teo runs it through a complicated network of companies that are registered in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. Corporate filings in China show Bai Zhisheng, a senior official in the city of Tianjin, as a director of two companies in partnership with Mr. Teo, including Desert Star Holdings, the entity that owns the China Horse Club. Mr. Bai has been a member of a regional committee charged with reforming state-owned companies since 2014. He did not respond to a request for comment. The club has marketed itself as both an investment opportunity and a networking group. Investors might see another potential benefit: a way to invest money overseas at a time when strict currency controls make it otherwise difficult. Mr. Harrington said that concept has never been a part of the club’s business plan, that the club also invests in China itself, and investors participate because they are drawn to the sport. The club closely vets all applicants before it accepts them, Mr. Harrington said. Shortly after the club was formed, Mr. Teo set up a joint venture to develop a property in Tianjin, less than two hours southeast of Beijing, billing it as Tianjin Equine Culture City. Little development occurred. Mr. Teo then shifted his focus to the China Equine Cultural Festival, an annual “lifestyle, business and thoroughbred racing” event. It has been held for the past two years in Ordos, Inner Mongolia, a quiet and largely empty city in northern China, and includes four races and multiple ceremonies honoring advisers and local government officials spread across two days. Around 17,000 people attended last year’s event, the club said, including John Warren, a member of the club’s international advisory council who is also the bloodstock and racing adviser to Queen Elizabeth; Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of St. Lucia; and Elliott Walden, the president and chief executive of WinStar Farm, with whom the club partnered, along with Head of Plains Partners and Starlight Racing, on Justify and Audible. Building a horse racing empire in a market as large as China is alluring. The Chinese New Year Raceday in February in Hong Kong, where racing is regulated and wagering is legal, attracted 89,084 people searching for a lucky start. The all-sources handle, or money bet, was about $221 million. The attendance for last year’s Derby was 158,070, but the handle was $209 million. However, significant hurdles remain, including the ban on wagering in China. Many wealthy businessmen have tried before Mr. Teo and failed. Tracks and veterinary facilities are inadequate, and there is a lack of quarantine facilities, which makes it difficult to get horses out of the country. The club’s events are organized on a local level, without the recognition of major regional or international bodies governing the sport. Mr. Teo’s project in St. Lucia, which is also a member of the British Commonwealth and home to about 200,000 people, includes plans for a casino, marina, mall, resort, free-trade zone and racetrack with room for 1,000 horses. In November 2016, Prince Harry, Mr. Chastanet and Mr. Teo broke ground. Then quarantine issues and legal problems over land acquisition delayed the nearly $3 billion project for more than a year. Mr. Chastanet said he did not know any other members of the club except Mr. Teo. The country’s passport program was a big draw for Mr. Teo, as well as the fact that there was no established horse racing industry, “so he was not stepping on anyone’s toes,” he said. Despite challenges on the development front, the club has made a splash in racing, with nearly 20 Group I or Grade I victories in Australia, England, France, Ireland, Singapore and the United States; and partners like Coolmore, WinStar and SF (Soros Fund) Bloodstock; and the international bloodstock advisers Mr. Flanagan and Mr. Wallace. About three years ago, it set its sights on the American market. “We did a lot of research and watched from afar for a good 12 months before we came on board,” said Mr. Wallace. The club secured its biggest victory in the United States to date last year at Churchill Downs, when Abel Tasman, co-owned by Clearsky Farms, came back from last place to win the Kentucky Oaks. The filly went on to win the Eclipse Award for 3-year-old Filly of the Year. On Saturday, Justify and Audible’s jockeys will be wearing WinStar’s white-and-green silks, a matter of following a rotation, Mr. Walden said. Abel Tasman’s jockey was to be in the China Horse Club’s red-and-yellow silks on Friday, as was Sassy Sienna’s. The club bought into that filly just days ago. Most of the club’s American partners say they do not know much about how the club is run or about its projects, but it has gained a reputation among owners and breeders for paying its bills on time in a business where that often does not happen. “Mr. Teo is a first-class man that we’ve had a tremendous relationship with,” Mr. Walden said. “He’s extremely smart and energetic and a great owner for our business.” That business now has even the biggest powers teaming up. “Why buy one horse when you can buy five, why buy five when you can buy 10, why buy 10 when you buy 20?” said Sol Kumin, a hedge fund executive who runs Head of Plains Partners, a co-owner of Justify and Audible. He is also involved with several other successful partnerships, including Monomoy Stables, which owns Derby entrant My Boy Jack and the Oaks favorite Monomoy Girl. Jack Wolf and his wife Laurie, who run the syndicate Starlight Racing, jumped at the opportunity to buy into Audible and Justify because they usually invest in unproven yearlings. “In my mind, as risky as this business is, and how capital intensive it is, then the partnership makes a lot of sense,” Jack Wolf said. About 20 members from the China Horse Club were said to be coming in for the Derby, in addition to partners from Head of Plains and Starlight. They may have different backgrounds, but they all know that in this business, nothing is a sure thing, not even space in the winner’s circle. “If either one of these horses wins, let’s hope there’s even enough room,” Jack Wolf said outside Audible’s barn. Presumably that space will be sufficient for a proper after-party."
72,2018-05-04,Qatar Steps In to Rescue Rosneft's Troubled Stake Sale to China,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-rosneft-qatar.html,353," LONDON/MOSCOW —  Qatar is taking a stake in Rosneft of nearly 19 percent, rescuing the Russian oil major from its stalled deal to sell a major stake to China's CEFC. The deal strengthens ties between Moscow and Doha at a time Qatar when is facing boycott by its Gulf Arab neighbours. Qatar's sovereign investment fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Swiss trading giant Glencore for 10.2 billion euros (9 billion pounds) during the Russian firm's partial privatisation in 2016. But last year the consortium agreed to sell a 14.16 stake in Rosneft to CEFC China Energy in a $9.1 billion deal that was seen as key to helping expand relations between Russia and China, the world’s top energy exporter and top energy consumer. That deal ran into trouble after CEFC founder and chairman Ye Jianming was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported in March. Glencore said on Friday that the consortium that had been selling the Rosneft stake had been dissolved, and said Qatar and Glencore would now own stakes directly. QIA would control an equity stake of 18.93 percent and Glencore would hold some 0.57 percent. Rosneft was hit hard by U.S. sanctions on Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and incursion in east Ukraine. Sources close to the QIA have said Rosneft could prove a profitable long-term investment given the giant firm is worth only $65 billion despite producing more crude than U.S. ExxonMobil, which is worth $324 billion. The fate of the CEFC deal, one of the largest investments by China in Russia, was seen as a litmus test of how far President Xi Jinping’s government was prepared to go with a crackdown on financially risky activities among big-spending conglomerates. Rosneft said it continued to consider China as a strategic market and said it believed that Qatar’s direct ownership would develop into new bilateral, international joint projects. A source close to the deal said Glencore would keep its long-term crude offtake agreement with Rosneft under the new arrangement.

73,2018-05-04,Russia's NLMK Says Could Close U.S. Business Due to Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-russia-nlmk-tariffs.html,353," MOSCOW —  Russia's top steelmaker NLMK may be forced to close its U.S. division due to the impact on its business of tariffs introduced by the United States in March. NLMK has applied for an exemption from the tariffs, which the United States maintains are based on national security concerns, and expects a decision on the matter in June. In a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce dated March 23, 2018, NLMK USA's Chief Executive Robert Miller said that the United States does not produce enough steel slabs for NLMK's U.S. division to be able to source them domestically. ""Without an exclusion for semi-finished steel slabs, the tariffs will have the perverse effect of killing U.S. steelmaking jobs and potentially putting our company out of business,"" Miller said. ""NLMK USA has made numerous attempts to secure slabs domestically, with little success. Between 2016-2017, NLMK Pennsylvania was only able to secure 2 percent of total receipts domestically and was forced to import the remaining amount,"" Miller said. U.S. tariffs threaten over 9,000 jobs at NLMK USA's Pennsylvania and Indiana mills, Miller wrote, as well as the more than 2,000 jobs a new NLMK marine terminal for the transportation of steel is expected to create. ""NLMK plans to nearly double its current investments (591 million pounds) with another $664 million (490 million pounds) between now and 2022. Tariffs on slabs put these investments on hold pending the outcome of the exclusion process,"" Miller said. Revenues of NLMK's U.S. division, at $1.67 billion in 2017, represented 16.5 percent of the company's total revenue worldwide that year. Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China. He has since temporarily excluded Canada, the European Union and Mexico from the duties until June 1, and has negotiated permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil. Russia, which has not received an exemption, has filed a request to join China in its official disputing of the tariffs at the World Trade Organisation.

74,2018-05-04,France Proposes New Mechanism to Assign Blame for Chemical Attacks,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-chemicalweapons-blame.html,610," THE HAGUE/PARIS —  Western powers are weighing a French proposal to create a new mechanism at the world's chemical weapons watchdog that would enable it to assign blame for attacks with banned munitions, diplomatic sources told Reuters. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague currently only determines whether such attacks have taken place, not who carried them out. A new mechanism could fulfil that role, which had been carried out since 2015 by a joint United Nations-OPCW investigation in Syria until its renewal was vetoed by Russia in November. ""On Syria everything is blocked at the U.N. Security Council and in general we are seeing repeated and systematic flouting of multilateral frameworks, including proliferation of chemical weapons,"" said a senior French diplomat. ""We need a mechanism to apportion blame. Salisbury was a step too far."" Creating a global mechanism for accountability is also seen as important due to a rising number of incidents with nerve agents since they were banned two decades ago under an international treaty. Recent use includes the assassination with VX of Kim Jong Nam, half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017 and the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal, a 66-year-old former Russian double agent, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia, with a Novichok nerve agent in March in Salisbury, England. They both survived. But the French proposal is also likely to meet resistance from Russia, Iran and others. Decisions at the OPCW are usually put to a vote by the 41-seat executive council, where 28 votes are needed to pass. Recent initiatives at the OPCW to condemn Syria for using chemical weapons have not garnered enough support. DEADLOCK The alternative is to go to the OPCW's full 192-seat conference of states, which can intervene to ensure compliance with the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which has been violated repeatedly by the use of sarin, chlorine and sulphur mustard gas in Syria, as well as the attacks in England and Malaysia. French President Emmanuel Macron discussed the new OPCW mechanism with the head of the OPCW, Ahmet Uzumcu, during a visit to the Netherlands in March. France is working with its close allies on the details of how the system would work, another source said. ""It would be a significant step forward if OPCW member states succeeded where the U.N. Security Council has failed due to Russia’s repeated vetoes,"" said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch. ""The important thing is to move quickly. If Moscow succeeds in preventing the OPCW from setting up an attribution mechanism to protect the Syrian government, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres should appoint one on his own authority."" The U.N. Security Council has been deadlocked over how to replace the U.N.-OPCW inquiry. In April the Security Council voted on and failed to adopt rival U.S. and Russian proposals to set up new inquiries into chemical weapons attacks in Syria. France, the United States and Britain then circulated a new draft resolution that aims to establish a new independent inquiry into who is responsible. However, Russia has said there was no point in establishing a new inquiry because the United States and its allies had already acted as judge and executioner. Talks on the Western draft have stalled. There are also diplomatic efforts at the United Nations to convince Guterres to appoint his own attribution mechanism. A suspected chemical attack on April 7 in the Douma enclave near Damascus prompted missile strikes by the United States, France and Britain against alleged chemical weapons facilities in Syria.

75,2018-05-04,UN Chief: Syria Must Respond to Chemical Weapons Questions,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/world/middleeast/ap-un-united-nations-syria-chemical-weapons.html,383," UNITED NATIONS —  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says Syria's failure to answer questions from the international chemical weapons watchdog about its chemical weapons program ""remains a source of very deep concern."" While the Syrian government partially addressed some questions raised by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the U.N. chief said ""other questions regrettably remain unanswered."" In a letter circulated Friday transmitting the OPCW's latest report to the Security Council, Guterres said he continues to urge Syria to resolve all outstanding issues. OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said in the report that he has repeated his requests to Syrian authorities that unanswered questions about its declarations of chemical weapons ""remain and require a response."" Guterres said ""the profoundly alarming allegations"" of chemical weapons use in the Damascus suburb of Douma on April 7 further underline the need for a new body to determine responsibility for chemical attacks. The OPCW said Friday that its fact-finding mission to Douma brought back samples for analysis at OPCW-designated laboratories — a process that could take at least three to four weeks. Its inspectors are only mandated to establish whether a chemical weapon was used, not to apportion blame. Russia vetoed a Western-backed council resolution in November that would have extended the mandate of a joint U.N.-OPCW body charged with determining responsibility for chemical attacks, dooming its operation and making accountability exceedingly difficult. Since then, the U.S. and Russia have been lashing out at each other over the issue of accountability for chemical attacks in Syria, which is a close ally of Moscow. In April, rival U.S. and Russian resolutions to set up a new body to determine responsibility suffered defeats in the council. Guterres warned that ""impunity and the absence of international consensus on accountability are escalating the conflict."" He reiterated that ""any confirmed use of chemical weapons by any party to the conflict is abhorrent, reprehensible and a clear violation of international law"" — and perpetrators must be held accountable. The OPCW report, covering the period from March 24 to April 23, says arrangements for destroying the last two chemical weapons production facilities in Syria ""are expected to be finalized in the coming weeks."" ""Once the arrangements are in place,"" it said, ""destruction operations are expected to take two to three months, subject to security conditions."""
76,2018-05-04,Flint Water Flagged as Poor Weeks Before Free Bottles Ended,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/ap-us-flint-water.html,277," FLINT, Mich. —  Michigan environmental experts warned that Flint's water system had ""significant deficiencies"" just weeks before Gov. Rick Snyder announced an end to bottled water service that was introduced to allay a lead-tainted water crisis. A surface water treatment engineer detailed 10 unresolved issues in a March 21 letter to Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. The letter said that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality has no confidence in Flint's capacity to manage the system. Snyder announced April 6 an end to free bottled water distribution, citing two years of testing showing Flint is below the federal action level for lead. Flint is recovering from its lead-contaminated water crisis and producing ""very high quality drinking water,"" said Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for the state's environmental department. ""The department's concern is the ability of the city to maintain that,"" Brown said. ""The treatment plant is not adequately staffed and is being supplemented by a short-term contract."" Brown also noted the viability of the water system's funding and whether the city can adopt a rate structure that will support operations. Michigan's environmental agency is working with the Flint to ensure that its water system is maintained, said Snyder's spokeswoman Anna Heaton. Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich is among many who have pushed for the bottled water service to continue until home water lines are replaced, which could take until 2020. He said Snyder's administration has struggled to rebuild trust since 2014, when it wrongly assured Flint residents that water provided from the Flint River was safe to drink. ""The state forced the shift (in water source) and caused the crisis,"" Ananich said. ""To say, 'mission accomplished,' is not accurate."""
77,2018-05-04,Statoil Targets Deeper Emission Cuts to Avoid Stranded Assets,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-statoil-emissions.html,433," LONDON/OSLO —  Norway's Statoil said it aims to cut its carbon footprint more aggressively as measures to reduce global warming could reduce the value of its assets, leaving some of its reserves stranded underground. The possibility that large quantities of the world's oil will never be developed due to the increase of renewable energy and the electrification of transport has been a growing worry for investors in the oil sector. Statoil, Norway's largest company, started stress testing its portfolio of oil and gas assets against global energy scenarios set out by the International Energy Agency (IEA) at shareholders' request in 2015. The IEA's Sustainable Development Scenario analyses the likely impact of energy policies by 2040. ""The net present value (NPV) (of Statoil's portfolio) will be reduced by 13 percent ... under the IEA (Sustainable Development) Scenario,"" Statoil's Chief Executive Eldar Saetre told Reuters. However, he said that would still leave Statoil's portfolio with a ""massive"" NPV. The IEA says its scenario is aligned with the Paris Agreement goals to keep global warming from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius. Saetre was speaking on the sidelines of a Statoil presentation to investors in London, where the company announced plans to reduce emissions from some of its new fields to 3 kg of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalents (boe), less than a fifth of the global average. Its carbon intensity at its offshore fields stood at 9 kg per boe in 2017, compared to a global average of 17 kg per boe. Statoil said optimisation and efficiency improvements have substantially strengthened its portfolio, which includes the giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield off Norway. The field will be powered from shore instead of generating electricity by offshore gas turbines, the main source of emissions on the Norwegian continental shelf. Statoil reduced its emissions from 11 kg of CO2 per boe in 2014, partly by divesting its carbon-intensive oil sand operations in Canada in 2016. Last year, it said it would no longer explore for heavy oil, which requires more energy and produces more emissions to lift barrels from the ground. However, the company still operates two heavy oilfields in Brazil and Britain, and is working with Rosneft to develop a high-viscous field in Russia. ""Despite the negative impact on NPV in the 'sustainable development scenario', we see very limited stranding of assets,"" Statoil said in its latest sustainability report. Royal Dutch Shell said last month that it saw little risk of having ""stranded assets"" in its portfolio because four-fifths of the oil major's current oil and gas reserves would be extracted before 2030 anyway.

78,2018-05-04,Israel Withdraws From Race for U.N. Security Council Seat,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/world/europe/04reuters-israel-un.html,407," UNITED NATIONS —  Israel withdrew on Friday from a race against Germany and Belgium for two seats on the United Nations Security Council in 2019-20. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly is due to vote next month on five new members for a two-year term starting on Jan. 1, 2019. Israel, Germany and Belgium were competing for two seats allocated to the Western European and Others Group. Germany and Belgium are now running uncontested, but they still need to win more than two-thirds of the overall General Assembly vote to be elected. ""It was decided that we will continue to act with our allies to allow for Israel to realise its right for full participation and inclusion in decision-making processes at the U.N.,"" Israel's mission to the United Nations said in a statement. A U.N. source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel had withdrawn because of its low chances of winning. Regional groups generally agree upon the candidates to put forward and competitive races for seats are increasingly rare. Each year the General Assembly elects five new members. Richard Grenell, who was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador to Germany on Thursday, said in March that the United States had brokered a deal in the 1990s with countries in the U.N.'s Western European and Others Group to allow Israel to run uncontested for a seat. Grenell, who was the U.S. spokesman at the U.N. from 2001 to 2009, tweeted about the issue on March 14. ""Israel has waited 19 years! The US must demand that Europe keep its word,"" he said. German diplomats denied any such agreement was made. The Israeli mission to the U.N. declined to comment at the time on Grenell's tweet. The council, on which the five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - hold veto powers, is the only U.N. body that can make legally binding decisions, as well as imposing sanctions and authorizing the use of force. To ensure geographical representation on the council, there are five seats for African and Asian states; one for Eastern European states; two for the Latin American and Caribbean states; and two for Western European and other states. Indonesia and the Maldives are competing for one Asia-Pacific seat in 2019-20, while South Africa and the Dominican Republic are running uncontested for the African and Latin American and Caribbean group seats.

79,2018-05-04,Idaho School Can't Find Small Bit of Weapons-Grade Plutonium,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/ap-us-missing-plutonium-idaho.html,546," BOISE, Idaho —  A small amount of radioactive, weapons-grade plutonium about the size of a U.S. quarter is missing from an Idaho university that was using it for research, leading federal officials on Friday to propose an $8,500 fine. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Idaho State University can't account for about a 30th of an ounce (1 gram) of the material that's used in nuclear reactors and to make nuclear bombs. The amount is too small to make a nuclear bomb, agency spokesman Victor Dricks said, but could be used to make a dirty bomb to spread radioactive contamination. ""The NRC has very rigorous controls for the use and storage of radioactive materials as evidenced by this enforcement action,"" he said of the proposed fine for failing to keep track of the material. Dr. Cornelis Van der Schyf, vice president for research at the university, blamed partially completed paperwork from 15 years ago as the school tried to dispose of the plutonium. ""Unfortunately, because there was a lack of sufficient historical records to demonstrate the disposal pathway employed in 2003, the source in question had to be listed as missing,"" he said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""The radioactive source in question poses no direct health issue or risk to public safety."" Idaho State University has a nuclear engineering program and works with the U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory, considered the nation's primary nuclear research lab and located about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of the school. The plutonium was being used to develop ways to ensure nuclear waste containers weren't leaking and to find ways to detect radioactive material being illegally brought into the U.S. following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the school said in an email to the AP. The university, which has 30 days to dispute the proposed fine, reported the plutonium missing on Oct. 13, according to documents released by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency said a school employee doing a routine inventory discovered the university could only account for 13 of its 14 plutonium sources, each weighing about the same small amount. The school searched documents and found records from 2003 and 2004 saying the material was on campus and awaiting disposal. However, there were no documents saying the plutonium had been properly disposed. The last document mentioning the plutonium is dated Nov. 23, 2003. It said the Idaho National Laboratory didn't want the plutonium and the school's technical safety office had it ""pending disposal of the next waste shipment."" The school also reviewed documents on waste barrels there and others transferred off campus since 2003, and opened and examined some of them. Finally, officials searched the campus but didn't find the plutonium. The nuclear commission said senior university officials planned to return the school's remaining plutonium to the Energy Department. It's not clear if that has happened. Energy Department officials didn't return calls seeking comment Friday. Dricks, the commission spokesman, said returning the plutonium was part of the school's plan to reduce its inventory of radioactive material. He said overall it has ""a good record with the NRC."" ___ This story has been corrected to show that the missing plutonium is about a 30th of an ounce, not a third of an ounce."
80,2018-05-04,Exclusive-World's Biggest Gold ETF Launching New Low-Fee Fund-Source,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-gold-etf-wgc.html,460," LONDON —  The World Gold Council, owner of the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund (ETF), is launching a new fund with a cut-price management fee to fend off rivals with lower charges, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The move is a sign that cost competition among gold ETFs is heating up after a price war in the much larger equities ETF sector slashed management fees. Gold ETFs allow buyers to invest in physical gold without having to buy and store the metal. The council's SPDR Gold Trust, which launched in 2004 and trades using the ticker GLD, dominates the industry but its share of total bullion held by gold-backed funds has slipped below 50 percent from 75 percent at the start of the decade, Reuters data show. <0#ETFHLD=XAU> <HLDTOTALL=XAU> GLD's gold holdings have risen 5 percent since the start of last year while rival iShares Gold Trust, which is run by investment manager BlackRock with a lower management fee, has grown 47 percent, by far the fastest growth among the five biggest gold ETFs tracked by Reuters. Other low-fee funds such as Deutsche Asset Management's Xtrackers Physical Gold ETC are growing rapidly and others such as GraniteShares <BAR>, launched last year, are popping up. GLD charges a fee of 40 basis points, or 0.4 percent, of the value of an investment, around the higher end of the market, while iShares Gold and Xtrackers take 25 basis points and GraniteShares 20 basis points, near the bottom. To view a graphic on iShares rising, click: https://reut.rs/2rjqukm The council's new fund will charge a fee of around 25 basis points, said the source, describing it as a ""countermove"" by the council to rivals' gains. The source said the council's two funds were designed to appeal to different audiences, with the new product targeted at investors looking to buy and hold gold who want a low management fee, and GLD aimed at financial investors who use its scale and liquidity to trade in and out of positions cheaply. ""The idea is that the new product grows without damaging the existing product,"" the source said. The World Gold Council declined to comment. To keep the offerings separate, shares in the new fund will represent a smaller allocation of gold than shares in GLD. This smaller share size will make it more expensive to move in and out of positions, encouraging financial investors to stick with SPDR, the source said. The World Gold Council filed for the new ETF in November last year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but did not reveal its management fee or share size. It is expected to launch the fund in the second quarter. (Reporting by Peter Hobson; Editing by Alexander Smith and Veronica Brown)"
81,2018-05-04,Exclusive-Redstone Makes Concessions on Viacom CEO in Bid to Clinch CBS Deal: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-viacom-cbs-m-a-exclusive.html,735," (Reuters) - Shari Redstone, the media heiress whose family controls CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, has offered CBS CEO Leslie Moonves to drop her demands for Viacom CEO Bob Bakish to be his No. 2 following a merger, as long as Bakish sits on the combined company's board, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The offer is an attempt by Redstone to resolve an impasse in the deal negotiations. Redstone has been trying to put together a deal that will keep Moonves, a 68-year-old media industry veteran credited with turning CBS around, at the helm, while positioning up-and-coming Bakish, 54, as Moonves' successor. CBS shares rose 8 percent after Reuters first reported Redstone's offer, giving the company a market value of $20 billion (£14.8 billion). Viacom shares were up 5 percent, giving it a value of $12.6 billion. Moonves has agreed to run the combined company for at least two years, as long as CBS Chief Operating Officer Joseph Ianniello will be president and chief operating officer of the combined company, so he can succeed him, sources have previously said. Redstone, daughter of media mogul Sumner Redstone, has offered not to give Bakish any executive role in the combined company, but still wants him to sit on the board of directors and eventually succeed Moonves, the sources said on Friday. Moonves does not want Bakish to be part of the combined company at all - either as an executive or board member - because he is seeking as much autonomy as possible in running the combined company, said one of the sources. As a result of the impasse over Bakish's role, CBS executives have serious doubts that a deal will happen, the source said. CBS and Viacom have also disagreed about the stock exchange ratio that should be used in a merger, although the two sides are making progress on that front, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements Inc, the company of Shari Redstone, declined to comment. Redstone offered her concessions earlier this week in a meeting with Moonves that included Richard Parsons, who recently joined the CBS board and is acting as a conduit between the two sides, the sources said. There has not been any agreement about the composition of a combined company's board, the sources said. Ten of the 14 director nominees for consideration at this year's CBS annual meeting are 70 or older. The average age is 72. The average for companies in the S&P 500 Index as a whole is 62. Two of Viacom's directors are 70 or older, according to the company's proxy statement. REUNITING AFTER SPLIT? CBS and Viacom set up special board committees to explore a merger in February, a move that would reunite the companies split by Sumner Redstone more than a decade ago. The merger would combine CBS's television network, local TV stations and Showtime cable network with Viacom’s cable networks, including MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, as well as its Paramount Pictures film studio. CBS and Viacom also explored a merger in 2016, instigated again by the Redstone family, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues. Since then, many of Viacom and CBS's competitors have combined, as scale becomes more important in the media business, with more customers cancelling pricey cable contracts and Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc spending billions of dollars on making shows and movies. AT&T Inc is seeking to buy Time Warner Inc, pending a judge's ruling on a Department of Justice lawsuit to block the deal. Walt Disney Co announced in December it would buy the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's assets. Discovery Communications recently acquired Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. In their price negotiations, Viacom last month asked for 0.68 CBS shares for each Viacom class B share, the sources said at the time. CBS had offered 0.55 of its shares for each Viacom class B share, sources have said. CBS reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped revenue and profit estimates. Last month, Viacom reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. ""The strategy that we have laid out for you is clearly working and the good news is that there is much more to come,"" Moonves said on a call with analysts on Thursday.

82,2018-05-04,Deutsche Bank to Move NY Headquarters From Wall Street,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/business/04reuters-deutsche-bank-relocation.html,165," (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank AG will shift its New York headquarters from Wall Street to a location midtown, at a time when Germany's largest bank is scaling back its U.S. operations. The bank will relocate to One Columbus Circle from 60 Wall Street, according to an internal memo to employees. The move is expected to start in the third quarter of 2021 and will be completed in 2022, according to a source familiar with the matter. The new location will consolidate the bank's New York presence and would reduce its commercial presence in the city by 30 percent, according to the memo. Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said last month that the bank would cut back bond and equities trading and would invest in German retail banking and asset management in Europe. The bank is expected to cut around 1,000 jobs or 10 percent of its workforce in the United States, Reuters reported last month.

83,2018-05-04,Kiprop&#8217;s Doping Failure Hits Kenya&#8217;s Cradle of Athletics,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/sports/04reuters-sport-doping-kiprop-kenya.html,821," ELDORET, Kenya —  The residents of Eldoret and Iten, considered Kenya’s home of distance running, are hurting following official confirmation that former Olympic and world 1,500 meters champion Asbel Kiprop has tested positive for the banned blood-booster EPO. The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU), an independent body handling doping matters on behalf of the sport's governing IAAF, earlier on Friday confirmed media reports that the 28-year-old three-time world champion over 1,500m had failed a dope test. The case is now with an International Association of Athletics Federations' disciplinary tribunal and the 28-year-old Kiprop, one of Kenya’s most decorated athletes, could face a four-year ban. There was a somber mood on the Eldoret streets among the local people and in Iten, Kiprop's home town, where the residents discussed the doping situation in subdued tones. “This one has hit us where it hurts most,"" Moses Kiptanui, a three-time world 3,000m steeplechase champion, told Reuters. ""Marathon runners failing dope tests was almost becoming normal. But when it came to the 1,500m, we were shocked. More so, Asbel (Kiprop), whom many youths looked to as a role model. ""We are mourning. From rural to urban areas, this has shaken everybody to the core,"" he said. Kiptanui, who runs an Eldoret department store, said the lack of tough anti-doping laws coupled with a laxity among Athletics Kenya (AK) officials and Kenyans' predilection for manipulating rules will bring the country's top sport to its knees. “Officials with vested interests, who are attracted by perks, and not the love of the game, are ruining the sport. Even with anti-doping laws in place, we don’t have policing which specializes in anti-doping matters,” said Kiptanui, who blew the whistle on doping problems in Kenya in 2003. However, Barnaba Korir, a member of the Athletics Kenya Executive Committee, defended the local governing body, saying Kenyans must accept that the country has a doping problem. “Let us accept that there is a problem and agree on how to tackle it. Blame game won’t help. Kenyans are still in denial yet this doping thing is festering,"" he said. ""Athletes are not children. They are responsible for what goes in their bodies. AK only sensitises and educates them on doping matters. They take full responsibility for their actions,"" he added. KIPROP'S ALLEGATIONS Kiprop alleged that testers extorted money from him, an allegation the AIU did not address. He also claimed that the testers might have interfered with his sample. The AIU, which was set up to combat all forms of corruption and ethical misconduct within athletics, was satisfied there was no interference with his sample but conceded that Kiprop had been given advance notice that he would be tested. This contravenes the World Anti-Doping Agency's guidelines stating that out-of-competition tests should be conducted without notice to athletes. Kiprop also alleged that he was being pressured to accept that he doped so that he could be made an IAAF ambassador against doping, an allegation the AIU rejected. Korir and Kiptanui questioned why Kiprop had engaged in what they said was a futile attempt to smear testers and the IAAF. “Why couldn’t he raise the matter when it happened? Why wait until now to reveal that testers extorted money from him?” asked Kiptanui. Korir also wondered why Kiprop was revealing so many of the details he should present to the IAAF tribunal. “The process is ongoing. The best thing Kiprop should do is wait for the appropriate time to argue his case. This was ill-advised,” he said. Kiprop is among almost 50 athletes from the east African nation, long revered for its distance running pedigree, who have failed doping tests, the most famous being former three-time Boston Marathon champion, Rita Jeptoo and Jemimah Sumgong, Olympics marathon gold medalist in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. The North Rift Valley towns of Eldoret and Iten, some 350km north-west of the capital Nairobi, rank distance running as their biggest foreign exchange earner. They take so much pride in their athletes that Eldoret has the name ‘city of champions’, Iten is known as the ‘home of champions’ while Kapsabet to the south, birthplace of twice Olympic champion Kipchoge Keino, is the 'source of champions'. In Iten, Jonah Kiplagat, a 32-year-old motorcyclist who retired from road running due to injury, said the residents of the hamlet on the edge of the picturesque Kerio Valley were commiserating with Kiprop. “He is our hero here. When we see his car zooming past, we are proud of him and the fame he has brought our town. This came as a shock to us,” he said. Social clubs in Iten, mostly frequented by sportspeople, were not doing much trade on Friday. The Mindililwo area where Kiprop built a training camp was like a ghost town. Situated on the Iten-Kapsowar road where two other celebrated athletes, marathon runners Wilson Kipsang and Edna Kiplagat, live, the news was on everyone's lips.

84,2018-05-04,Dozens of Wild Horses Found Dead Amid Southwest Drought,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/04/us/ap-us-drought-dead-horses.html,867," CAMERON, Ariz. —  Off a northern Arizona highway surrounded by pastel-colored desert is one of the starkest examples of drought's grip on the American Southwest: Dozens of dead horses surrounded by cracked earth, swirling dust and a ribbon of water that couldn't quench their thirst. Flesh exposed and in various stages of decomposition, the carcasses form a circle around a dry watering hole sunken in the landscape. It's clear this isn't the first time the animals have struggled. Skeletal remain are scattered on the fringes and in an adjacent ravine. It's a symptom of a burgeoning wild horse population and the scarcity of water on the western edge of the Navajo Nation following a dry winter and dismal spring runoff. Conditions aren't forecast to improve anytime soon, and tribal officials suspect other animals have died with not enough to eat or drink. ""One of the things we do is we picture the worst-case scenario when we got out there,"" said Harlan Cleveland of the tribe's Department of Emergency Management. ""I did smell the decomposition and the bodies starting to smell, the carcasses. But I didn't realize until I looked down from the berm and saw all those horses down there."" Here, drought doesn't manifest in having to shut down swimming pools or let lawns go dry. This rural community does not have its own potable water source. Those who have running water in their homes get it from a well, piped from over 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) away. Most haul water, carrying large plastic tanks in the beds of their pickup trucks. The groundwater is brackish and recommended for livestock only, but the two storage tanks closest to the watering hole no longer function. Animals were accustomed to finding relief at the stock pond where the horses died, but locals say the pool of water beneath the decades-old earthen dam has dried up more quickly each year. Families have been downsizing their herds because they can't rely on the vegetation or watering holes. Some have hauled water and left it in troughs for animals. Charlie Smith Jr. climbed the small berm overlooking the watering hole three weeks ago in search of his cattle. At the time, he counted 29 dead horses and a cow that wasn't his stranded at the edge looking up at him. ""It's very emotional,"" he said, standing beside his truck loaded with hay. ""I kept calling my sister saying 'this is bad.' It just hits you. You tear up. You know you don't have the capability to save them."" Tribal officials counted 118 dead horses and two cows this week but that tally doesn't account for any carcasses that might have been pushed deeper into the mud by the other struggling animals, or for skeletal remains. Tribal officials estimate tens of thousands of feral horses on the Navajo Nation, the country's largest reservation spanning 27,000 square miles (69,929.679 square kilometers) in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. Some communities have called for roundups, but often they're halted with public outcry tied to Navajo spiritual beliefs about the animals and the role they play in prayers and ceremonies. When Emmett Kerley was a teenager in the late 1970s in Gray Mountain, the community controlled horse populations by castrating the smaller ones, he said. Navajo culture taught that young men should train horses and tame them, part of building endurance, a strong work ethic and managing livestock, he said. ""There were no feral horses back then, but then the society changed in greater America but on Navajo, on the reservation as well,"" he said. Staff with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs put up a barbed wire fence around the watering hole where horses laid overlapping one another. Federal and tribal workers this week used heavy equipment to bring horses found on the outskirts closer to the others. Hydrated lime was spread over the site to aid decomposition and to ward off scavengers. Friday's work focused on collapsing the berm and burying the animals on site. Eventually, the tribe will redirect any water that flowed into that watering hole into a safer area. ""Knock on wood, God forbid, that we have that situation anywhere else within the reservation,"" Cleveland said. ""This will lay the foundation for how we respond to this."" For all the devastation, there was a bright spot. As Cleveland surveyed ground earlier this week determining how best to respond to the deaths, he saw a foal — no more than four weeks old — moving next to what was assumed to be its mother. Tribal officials carried it to a truck and used a long-sleeved, white T-shirt to keep it warm for the trip to a veterinary clinic 45 minutes away. They named her Grace. Erin Hisrich, who owns the clinic, said Grace was severely dehydrated and will need to have her blood-sugar stabilized and kidneys functioning before she could be adopted. On Thursday, the brown foal with a long patch of white hair on its face splashed in a tub of water and cozied up to visitors. ""In the end, that made my day responding to this emergency and this chaotic scene,"" Cleveland said. ""At least this baby foal made it out."""
85,2018-05-04,Pence’s Doctor Resigns as White House Medical Shake-Up Continues,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/trump-pence-jackson-white-house-doctor.html,652," Vice President Mike Pence’s physician abruptly resigned on Friday with no public explanation, part of a bitter feud that has led to a shake-up in the small medical office that is responsible for treating President Trump, his family and other White House officials. The White House Medical Unit has come under scrutiny in recent days after Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Mr. Trump’s primary physician whom he selected to be secretary of veterans affairs, withdrew from consideration amid allegations that he overprescribed medication and was drunk on the job. The president vigorously defended Dr. Jackson, a Navy rear admiral, saying he was a good man who had been falsely accused and treated unfairly. This week, CNN reported that one source of damaging accusations against Dr. Jackson had been Jennifer Pena, Mr. Pence’s physician, who drew up memos last fall alleging misconduct by the president’s doctor, including a violation of medical privacy laws and threatening behavior. On Friday, Mr. Pence’s office issued a short statement confirming the departure of Dr. Pena, but did not elaborate on the reason, suggesting that the matter was not handled by the vice president’s staff. “The vice president’s office was informed today by the White House Medical Unit of the resignation,” Alyssa Farah, Mr. Pence’s press secretary, said in a statement. “Physicians assigned to the vice president report to the White House Medical Unit and thus any resignation would go entirely through the medical unit, not the vice president’s office.” White House officials and others familiar with the situation said the circumstances surrounding Dr. Jackson’s fall from grace and Dr. Pena’s departure dated back many years, to longstanding divisions in the medical unit — which is part of the military — where there are two factions that do not get along. Dr. Pena — known to patients simply as “Dr. Jen” — submitted her memos about Dr. Jackson last fall to Nick Ayers, Mr. Pence’s chief of staff, who shared them with John F. Kelly, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. Both Mr. Ayers and Mr. Kelly directed Dr. Pena to go through her military chain of command to address the issue, the person said. CNN, which obtained the memos, reported that Dr. Pena had accused Dr. Jackson of having intervened in a medical matter involving Karen Pence, Mr. Pence’s wife, and possibly violating her medical privacy rights. She also said Dr. Jackson had become irate and aggressive during a confrontation over the situation, and that he had fostered an unprofessional atmosphere in the medical unit. Dr. Jackson, an Iraq war veteran, has insisted that all the allegations against him were untrue, an assertion backed up by Mr. Trump and numerous White House aides from the current and previous administration. But some members of the medical unit, which houses a few dozen doctors and nurses, described Dr. Jackson as a bully and a sloppy record-keeper, who drank too much — sometimes becoming intoxicated during overseas trips with the president — and loosely dispensed strong drugs to curry favor with the powerful politicians and political aides he admired. Several of them detailed the alleged misconduct in interviews with the Democratic staff of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Despite Mr. Trump’s strong defense of him, Dr. Jackson has not resumed his job as the top physician in the medical unit since he announced his withdrawal from consideration as secretary of veterans affairs. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that another doctor, Sean Conley, who had been acting in Dr. Jackson’s role while he prepared for confirmation hearings, would stay in the post instead. “Dr. Jackson continues to be an active-duty Navy doctor that’s assigned here at the White House,” Ms. Sanders said, “where there are a number of doctors that are part of the White House Medical Unit.”"
86,2018-05-05,"2 F.B.I. Officials, Once Key Advisers to Comey, Leave the Bureau",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/politics/james-baker-lisa-page-fbi.html,453," WASHINGTON — Two top F.B.I. aides who worked alongside the former director James B. Comey as he navigated one of the most politically tumultuous periods in the bureau’s history resigned on Friday. One of them, James A. Baker, was one of Mr. Comey’s closest confidants. He served as the F.B.I.’s top lawyer until December when he was reassigned as the new director, Christopher A. Wray, began installing his own advisers. Mr. Baker had been investigated by the Justice Department on suspicion of sharing classified information with reporters. He has not been charged. The other aide, Lisa Page, advised Mr. Comey while serving directly under his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe. She was assailed by conservatives after texts that she had exchanged with the agent overseeing the investigation into links between President Trump’s campaign and Russia were made public. In the messages, they expressed anti-Trump views but took aim at Hillary Clinton and other political figures as well. The decisions by Mr. Baker and Ms. Page to leave the bureau were unrelated. Mr. Baker said in a telephone interview that he would be joining the Brookings Institution to write for Lawfare, its blog focused on national security law. “I love the F.B.I.,” he said. “I have tremendous respect for the bureau — the F.B.I. was great, is great and will be great.” Mr. Comey relied heavily on Mr. Baker as he oversaw the politically charged investigations into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server and Mr. Trump’s campaign. After the president pressed Mr. Comey to say publicly that he was not under investigation, Mr. Baker cautioned against it because he anticipated that the F.B.I. would eventually have to examine Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia. The president abruptly fired Mr. Comey a year ago and has cited a variety of rationales. His lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani said this week that Mr. Comey was ousted because he declined to say publicly that Mr. Trump was not under scrutiny at the time in the Russia investigation. Ms. Page advised F.B.I. leadership on one of Mr. Comey’s most consequential decisions in the investigation into Mrs. Clinton: his move to hold a news conference to announce that the bureau was recommending that she face no charges. House Republicans have also accused Mr. Baker of being the source of the leaks about a salacious dossier of information about Mr. Trump compiled by a former British spy. Mr. Comey said in a statement that Mr. Baker “represents the best of the Department of Justice and the F.B.I.” “He has protected the country and the rule of law throughout his career and leaves an inspiring legacy of service,” Mr. Comey said. “He is what we should all hope our kids become, a person of integrity.”"

88,2018-05-05,Hard-Line US Demands on China Raise Stakes in Trade Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/05/world/asia/ap-as-china-us-trade.html,1095," BEIJING —  A list of hard-line demands that the Trump administration handed China this week could make it even more difficult to resolve a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies. That's the view of trade analysts who say the U.S. insistence that Beijing shrink America's gaping trade deficit with China by $200 billion by the end of 2020, among other demands, is more likely to raise tensions than to calm them. The thrust of the demands is that China should give up policies that favor domestic companies especially in a strategic rivalry with the U.S. over technology — policies Beijing considers core to its state-driven economic model and vital for its future growth. An editorial on Saturday by China's ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily, said Beijing was willing to engage in discussions that brought benefits to both sides but would not give in to strong-arm tactics that hurt China's interests. ""In the face of the U.S.'s fierce offensive of protectionism, China resolutely defends its national interest,"" the People's Daily said. ""It will never trade away its core interests and rejects the U.S.'s demand for an exorbitant price."" A U.S. official confirmed the authenticity of a document outlining U.S. priorities that was presented to China ahead of two days of trade talks that ended Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the talks. In Washington on Friday, President Donald Trump said, ""We have to bring fairness in trade between the U.S. and China, and we will do that."" Trump had campaigned for the presidency on a promise to reduce America's trade deficit with China, which amounted last year to $337 billion in goods and services. ""We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!"" Trump tweeted. The intensifying trade dispute between the United States and China has rattled financial markets for weeks. In March, the Trump administration slapped tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. China counterpunched with tariffs on a range of U.S. products, including bourbon and blue jeans. An even higher-stakes fight looms over American allegations that China steals technology and forces U.S. companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market. The United States is considering imposing tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, and Beijing has countered with proposed tariffs on $50 billion in American products, including soybeans and small aircraft. Seeking to avert a trade war, the United States this week sent a high-level delegation to Beijing, led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The delegation included Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser and hard-line critic of Chinese policies. After the talks ended, China's Commerce Ministry said the two sides had agreed to establish a mechanism to try to resolve their dispute, though differences remained, Chinese state media reported. The report did not give specifics, suggesting that little progress had been achieved. The U.S. document is described, in an introductory disclaimer, as being provided to the Chinese ahead of the visit to Beijing by the U.S. officials. It included demands that China immediately stop providing subsidies to industries listed in a key industrial plan. China must end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute, the list also says. The U.S. wants China not to retaliate against U.S. measures currently being pursued against it. For instance, the U.S. says China should agree not to target U.S. farmers or agricultural products and ""not oppose, challenge or otherwise retaliate"" when the U.S. moves to restrict Chinese investment in the U.S. in sensitive sectors. American analysts were struck by the aggressiveness of the Trump team's demands. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the hard-nosed approach ""makes it harder to envision a path toward a negotiated settlement."" Prasad said the Chinese are open to negotiations on opening their market wider and doing a better job of protecting intellectual property. ""Beijing is clearly in no mood, however, to meet the U.S. team's expectation of capitulation in the face of threats of tariffs and other trade sanctions,"" he said. Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who specialized in Asia, said it was encouraging to see the two countries talking and trading proposals. But she said the ""kitchen sink"" U.S. demands look unrealistic. ""If the U.S. is serious and wants all of this, it's hard to see a constructive path forward,"" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. Analysts said the Chinese were likely to view the confrontational posture struck by the U.S. as unreasonable and akin to bullying, potentially making it difficult to tone down friction over such issues. Yu Miaojie, a professor at Peking University's National School of Development, described some of the demands as ""like lions opening their mouths."" ""When it comes to negotiations, both sides can provide a list of requests and we will seek common ground while reserving our differences,"" Yu said. ""If one side provides a list with unreasonable requests, the Chinese government is unable to accept it."" Still, the list was welcomed by a U.S. business group which has lobbied the Trump administration for greater clarity on what it wanted China to do. Some groups had complained the administration was sending mixed messages. ""We've been saying that the Trump administration needs to define success and what specific outcomes it is seeking,"" said Jake Parker, vice president for China of the U.S.-China Business Council. The list submitted to China helps ""lead to a solution and avoid tariffs and other sanctions,"" he said. Still, the situation is likely to escalate with both sides unwilling to back down, analysts say. ""There should now be no doubt in anyone's mind that the Trump administration is not bluffing and that it is willing to launch a full-scale trade war if China doesn't radically rein in its industrial policy machine and create a more level playing field,"" wrote Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. ""Given China's ornery response, it appears Beijing is also willing to go down this path if necessary to keep its system intact regardless of the consequences,"" Kennedy wrote in a commentary. ___ Wiseman reported from Washington. Associated Press writers Kelvin Chan in Hong Kong, Martin Crutsinger in Washington and Christopher Bodeen and researcher Yu Bing in Beijing contributed to this report."
89,2018-05-05,"Trump Says Time, Place Set for Planned US-North Korea Summit",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/05/us/politics/ap-us-trump-korea.html,813," WASHINGTON —  President Donald Trump is offering his latest teaser for a historic U.S. summit with North Korea: The time and place have been set, but he's not saying when and where. The White House on Friday did announce the details of a separate meeting later this month between Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as Washington pushed back on a report that Trump is considering the withdrawal of U.S. forces from its ally. Trump and Moon plan to meet at the White House on May 22 to ""continue their close coordination on developments regarding the Korean Peninsula"" following last Friday's meeting between Moon and Kim Jong Un. They will also discuss the U.S. president's own upcoming summit with the North Korean leader, a statement said. Earlier this week, Trump expressed a preference for holding the ""big event"" with Kim in the demilitarized zone or DMZ between the two Koreas, where Moon and Kim met. He also said Singapore was in contention to host what will be the first summit of between a U.S. and a North Korean leader. ""We now have a date and we have a location. We'll be announcing it soon,"" Trump told reporters Friday from the White House South Lawn before departing for Dallas. He's previously said the summit was planned for May or early June. A meeting with Kim seemed an outlandish possibility just a few months ago when the two leaders were trading threats and insults over North Korea's development of nuclear weapons. But momentum for diplomacy has built this year as the rival Koreas have patched up ties. In March, Trump unexpectedly accepted an offer of talks from Kim after the North Korean dictator agreed to suspend nuclear and ballistic missile tests and discuss ""denuclearization."" According to South Korea, Kim has said he'd be willing to give up his nukes if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and pledges not to attack the North. But his exact demands for relinquishing weapons that his nation spent decades building remains unclear. Trump said that withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea is ""not on the table."" Some 28,500 U.S. forces are based in the allied nation, a military presence that has been preserved to deter North Korea since the war ended in 1953 without a peace treaty. ""Now I have to tell you, at some point into the future, I would like to save the money,"" Trump said later as he prepared to board Air Force One. ""You know we have 32,000 troops there but I think a lot of great things will happen but troops are not on the table. Absolutely."" The New York Times reported that Trump has asked the Pentagon to prepare options plans for drawing down American troops. It cited unnamed officials as saying that wasn't intended to be a bargaining chip with Kim, but did reflect that a prospective peace treaty between the Koreas could diminish the need for U.S. forces in South Korea. At the inter-Korean summit last Friday, held on the southern side of the DMZ, Moon and Kim pledged to rid the peninsula of nuclear weapons and seek a formal end this year to the Korean conflict where the opposing sides remain technically at war more than six decades after fighting halted with an armistice. But for Trump to contemplate withdrawing troops now would be a quixotic move as he enters into negotiations with Kim whose demands and intentions are uncertain. Two weeks ago, shortly before the inter-Korean summit, Moon said that Kim actually wasn't insisting on a longstanding demand for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as a precondition for abandoning his nukes. National security adviser John Bolton, who met his South Korean counterpart Chung Eui-yong in Washington on Friday, called the Times report ""utter nonsense."" During his presidential campaign, Trump complained that South Korea does not do enough to financially support the American military commitment. In March, Washington and Seoul began negotiations on how much South Korea should offset the costs of the deployment in the coming years. Under the current agreement that expires at the end of 2018, the South provides about $830 million per year. Before Trump meets Kim, Washington is looking for North Korea to address another persistent source of tension between the adversaries: the detention of three Korean-Americans accused of anti-state of activities in the North. Trump hinted that the release of Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song and Tony Kim was in the offing, but again was sparing on the details. ""We're having very substantive talks with North Korea and a lot of things have already happened with respect to the hostages, and I think you're going to see very good things. As I said yesterday, stay tuned,"" Trump said, referring to an earlier tweet on the issue. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Thomas contributed to this report."
90,2018-05-05,Qatar Steps In to Rescue Rosneft's Troubled Stake Sale to China,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/05/business/05reuters-rosneft-qatar.html,513," LONDON/MOSCOW —  Qatar is taking a nearly 19 percent stake in Rosneft, rescuing the Russian oil major from its stalled deal to sell a major stake to China's CEFC. The deal strengthens ties between Moscow and Doha at a time when Qatar is facing boycott by its Gulf Arab neighbours. Qatar's sovereign investment fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Swiss trading giant Glencore for 10.2 billion euros (9.01 billion pounds) during the Russian firm's partial privatisation in 2016. But last year the consortium agreed to sell a 14.16 stake in Rosneft to CEFC China Energy in a $9.1 billion deal that was seen as key to helping expand relations between Russia and China, the world's top energy exporter and top consumer. That deal ran into trouble after CEFC Founder and Chairman Ye Jianming was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported in March. Glencore said on Friday that the consortium that had been selling the Rosneft stake had been dissolved, and said Qatar and Glencore would now own stakes directly. QIA would control an equity stake of 18.93 percent and Glencore would hold some 0.57 percent. CEFC has not commented publicly since the termination of the deal was announced. The company did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Calls to its Shanghai headquarters were not answered on Saturday. The once high-flying conglomerate is now conducting fire sales of its assets following the investigation into its chief and offering staff severance packages after failing to pay them for two months, as creditors scramble to collect debts amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the firm. ""CEFC China's purchase of a stake in Rosneft has ended in a debacle. Russia's pivot to the East now feels more like a pivot to the Middle East, with Qatar coming to the rescue,"" said Christian Boermel, senior research analyst, Russia Upstream, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. PROFITABLE INVESTMENT Rosneft was hit hard by U.S. sanctions on Russia over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and incursion in east Ukraine. But sources close to QIA have said Rosneft could prove a profitable long-term investment given the giant firm is worth only $65 billion despite producing more crude than U.S. ExxonMobil, which is worth $324 billion. The fate of the CEFC deal, one of the largest investments by China in Russia, was seen as a litmus test of how far President Xi Jinping's government was prepared to go with a crackdown on financially risky activities among big-spending conglomerates. Rosneft has, however, said it continues to consider China as a strategic market and that it will supply its term contracts based on the agreed timing and volumes to CEFC. The Russian oil major in 2017 signed a five-year contract to supply 12 million tonnes of oil per year to the Chinese firm. Glencore will also keep its long-term crude offtake agreement with the Russian producer under the new arrangement, a source told Reuters.

91,2018-05-05,Patagonia v. Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/patagonia-trump-bears-ears.html,3405," VENTURA, Calif. — The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot, day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach, where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts, where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year. But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December, Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company’s home page. It wasn’t a business crisis that had mobilized the company, however. It was politics. Hours earlier, President Trump had announced plans to sharply reduce the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears, an expanse of red-rock canyons rich with archaeologically significant sites, would be slashed in size by 85 percent, more than one million acres. Another monument, Grand Staircase-Escalante, would be reduced by half. Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. “Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington,” he said. “And guess what. They’re wrong.” Yet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation, including Patagonia, the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands, and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining. Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years, the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days — and many do so uncomfortably — Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s. It bills itself “the Activist Company” and publicly advocates for environmental protection, fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists, and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December, Patagonia had never tangled with a president. That Monday morning, about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump’s speech. The mood was somber. Then, within an hour of the president’s remarks, Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products, there was a stark message against a black background: “The President Stole Your Land.” At the same time, Patagonia’s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president. Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells, Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, the secretary of agriculture, the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them. “For as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments, Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments,” the lawsuit reads. “Congress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.” Patagonia’s activism has made the company plenty of enemies over the years. Developers, the fossil fuel industry and lawmakers have all gone after the company, and this time was no exception. As Patagonia ramped up its campaign, the Trump administration hit back. Mr. Zinke and Republicans in Congress accused Patagonia of playing politics to sell more clothes, and the hashtag #BoycottPatagonia began circulating on Twitter. The barbs only stiffened Patagonia’s resolve. The company’s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration “evil.” And Rose Marcario, Patagonia’s chief executive officer, made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities. “We’ve always given to grass-roots organizations; it’s part of our D.N.A.,” she said in a recent interview at company headquarters, an American flag flying outside her window. “But the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.” It would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump’s announcement, a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula, Calif., a small community not far from Patagonia’s headquarters. The hot, dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno, and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president, its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes. “We did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit,” said Corley Kenna, Patagonia’s head of communications. “We didn’t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.” Patagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard, an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957, he taught himself to blacksmith, and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park. Within a few years, he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia, a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America, where he had recently traveled. Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part, the company was a means to an end, a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf, climb and travel their way around the world. That changed in 1972, when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered, the flow of the river would have been changed, and a prized surf break could have been ruined. At the meeting, it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist, Mark Capelli, took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds, water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted, the river was protected, and the surf break was preserved. Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work, giving free office space to his nascent organization, Friends of the Ventura River, and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river. That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists, give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy, and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia’s sales to support environmental activism. Patagonia has given out thousands of grants. In Alaska, the company has supported efforts to prevent waste from mining operations from polluting Bristol Bay, a productive salmon fishery. In Yellowstone National Park, Patagonia has worked to protect grizzly bears. In Poland, the company has advocated for the protection of forests. And Patagonia has waded into national politics before, having opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The company has produced feature-length documentary films, including “DamNation,” an argument against damming rivers. Every other year, it hosts a conference where activists share tips and best practices for protests, fund-raising and litigation. And in 2011, Patagonia famously placed an ad in The New York Times that read, “Don’t Buy This Jacket,” an effort to discourage excessive consumption. “Patagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem, and are willing to be very public about their advocacy,” said Neil Kornze, who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. “They are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.” Business is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years, Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer, drawn to the company’s environmental activism. “That’s why I’m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money,” she said. “I’m kind of worried about the planet.” She was named chief executive in 2014, and has overseen Patagonia’s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years, according to the company. Under Ms. Marcario’s guidance, Patagonia has also struck out in new directions. It started a venture capital arm, Tin Shed Ventures, named after the metal hut — still standing — where Mr. Chouinard once forged and hammered metal, and has invested some $75 million in eco-friendly start-ups. It has opened a food business, Patagonia Provisions, selling dried buffalo, lentil soup and beer. It recently activated a social network of sorts, Patagonia Action Works, designed to connect engaged consumers with local environmental campaigns. And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985, Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes. “Science without activism is dead science,” Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. “We want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines, the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.” In 2012, one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa, a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah, including the area that would become Bears Ears. At the time, Republicans in Utah, notably Representative Rob Bishop, were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining, bringing in additional state tax revenue. Patagonia ramped up its support for Friends of Cedar Mesa, offering grants and producing a short film about Josh Ewing, the organization’s director, who goes rock climbing in the area. It was the kind of assistance Patagonia had offered to thousands of local groups over the years, and at the time, there was no sense that Bears Ears would soon become a point of contention in a national debate over public lands. “Patagonia has been interested in this area for a long time,” Mr. Ewing said. “More than any company I’ve ever seen, they put their money where their mouth is.” As Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears, which was a favorite of rock climbers, it came to appreciate the area’s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls, it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining. “As we got more involved, we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place,” said Lisa Pike Sheehy, Patagonia’s vice president of environmental activism. “This was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.” In total, Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears, including making grants to nonprofit groups, producing films and other marketing materials, and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment, they worked. In December 2016, with less than a month left in his administration, Mr. Obama designated two new national monuments, including Bears Ears. It was a last-ditch effort by Mr. Obama to secure as much of his environmental legacy as possible. But with Mr. Trump’s inauguration looming, supporters of the monuments knew the victory might be fleeting. “We never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created,” Mr. Ewing said. “The writing was on the wall. There wasn’t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.” Inside Patagonia, Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump’s election, Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. “Defending our air, soil and water has never been more important,” she wrote. “In the last few years, our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger … we won’t stop.” The fears were quickly realized. Shortly after Mr. Trump took office, he ordered a review of some national monuments, vowing to “end another egregious use of government power.” During a monthslong public comment period, the Interior Department received more than two million submissions, the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150,000 comments. During the first months of the new administration, Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee, Hans Cole, made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations, according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place, but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff. Around this time, Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells, which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs. Meanwhile, Patagonia ramped up its publicity efforts around Bears Ears and public lands. The company worked with Google to start a website featuring videos, virtual reality and information about Bears Ears. It aired its first-ever television ad, featuring Mr. Chouinard sitting by a river, reflecting on the virtues of wild places. And Patagonia succeeded in its monthslong, retaliatory campaign to move a lucrative trade show out of Utah. For years, the Outdoor Retailer trade show had taken place in Salt Lake City, bringing business and tourism revenue to the state. But when politicians didn’t budge after Patagonia demanded that they voice their support for public lands, the Outdoor Retailer show was moved to Denver. The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy, spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed. In the end, none of this made much of a difference. In August, Mr. Zinke proposed reductions to four monuments, including Bears Ears. Then Mr. Trump made his proclamation on Monday, Dec. 4, and all hell broke loose. That evening, Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast, returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia’s headquarters, she could see flames encircling Ventura. “I saw the whole ridge line on fire,” she said. “I realized we wouldn’t be able to go back to the office.” Patagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus, and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate. A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia, putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread, surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town. “There was ash falling like rain,” Ms. Marcario said. “It was something I have never seen before.” As the fire spread north, Patagonia and the Trump administration sparred publicly. Mr. Chouniard, typically a recluse, took to the airwaves to bash Mr. Trump. “This government is evil, and I’m not going to sit back and let evil win,” he said on CNN. Mr. Zinke hit back. “You mean Patagonia made in China?” he said on a press call, accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. “I think it’s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.” Then on Fox Business Network, Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia’s activism. “They should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country, rather than lying to the public about losing federal land,” he said. The House Committee on Natural Resources, chaired by Mr. Bishop, joined the fracas. “Patagonia is lying to you,” the committee wrote on Twitter. “A corporate giant hijacking our public lands debate to sell more products to wealthy elitist urban dwellers from New York to San Francisco.” Soon, the hashtag #BoycottPatagonia began circulating among Trump supporters on Twitter, and Stephen Colbert worked Patagonia into his “Late Show” routine. As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs, the blaze, known as the Thomas Fire, became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month, it destroyed more than 1,000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100,000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared, but five employees lost their homes. With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6, Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito, 30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her, though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate, too. “Then in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse, across my inbox comes an email,” she said. “Patagonia versus Donald Trump, et al.” Ms. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president. Since that week in December, the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer. Mr. Bishop invited Mr. Chouinard to testify before the Committee on Natural Resources. Mr. Chouinard declined the offer, calling any hearing a “macabre celebration of the largest reduction in public lands in American history,” and the committee part of a “failed Orwellian government.” Mr. Bishop replied to Mr. Chouinard with a tart letter of his own. “Although it is your right, living in a bubble isn’t healthy, nor is it conducive to a robust discussion on important matters of public policy,” he said. In an email, the committee’s press secretary said Mr. Chouinard was still welcome to testify. Then in March, The Times published an article that showed oil and gas interests were central to the Trump administration’s decision to shrink Bears Ears. After that, Patagonia updated its website yet again. The new copy: “The President Stole Your Land and You Were Lied To.” “The decision was nothing more than a political favor,” Ms. Sheehy, the company’s vice president of environmental activism, wrote in a blog post. “The redrawing of boundaries was deliberate, and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.” The Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were “patently and demonstrably false.” Ms. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire, which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change. “These are climate disasters, and they’re going to get worse and worse,” Ms. Marcario said. “We have an administration that isn’t paying any attention to that.” And the disasters weren’t over yet. In January, torrential rains hit the area. Hillsides eroded by the Thomas Fire came loose, and devastating mudslides roared through Montecito, killing more than 20 people and damaging the homes of several Patagonia employees. Patagonia’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups, and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision, and until then, all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells, which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis, has billed $1.7 million in hours to date. In the meantime, the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use, including drilling and mining, though there hasn’t yet been any new development. At Patagonia, Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end, it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection. “These are all long fights,” she said. “We’re in this for 50 years, 100 years.”"
92,2018-05-05,What Is Cinco de Mayo?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/cinco-de-mayo-facts-history.html,601," Saturday is Cinco de Mayo, a day often mistaken in the United States for Mexico’s Independence Day. In fact, the holiday had its origin more than 50 years after the date associated with the country’s independence. So here’s what you need to know about Cinco de Mayo, including its evolution into a major economic driver for business owners and beverage companies across the United States. Cinco de Mayo, which isn’t widely celebrated in Mexico, commemorates an underdog victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The victory was galvanizing for the Mexican forces — and for those supporting them from afar — but it was short-lived, as France later occupied Mexico for a few years. Still, Cinco de Mayo continued to be celebrated in Puebla and, perhaps more significantly, by Mexican-Americans north of the border. The country’s Independence Day is Sept. 16, now a national holiday. On that day in 1810, a priest named Miguel Hidalgo implored Mexico to revolt against Spain, leading to the War for Independence, which ended in 1821. In the early 1960s, many Mexican-American activists entrenched in the country’s growing civil rights movement used the day as a source of pride. Close to two decades later, in 1989, an ad campaign by an importer of beers like Modelo and Corona was introduced around the day. The campaign was initially targeted toward Latinos but eventually broadened with print and TV ads. This year, Corona’s website featured a ticking “Countdown to Corona de Mayo” in the hours leading up to May 5. The commercialization of Cinco de Mayo (and criticism of cultural stereotypes) has taken off. The research firm Nielsen reported that in 2013 Americans bought more than $600 million worth of beer for Cinco de Mayo, more than for the Super Bowl or St. Patrick’s Day. David Hayes-Bautista, a professor at U.C.L.A., published a book in 2012 titled “El Cinco de Mayo: An American Tradition.” In the book, he called “Cinco de Mayo” a “fake holiday recently invented by beverage companies.” The holiday’s evolution from an earnest show of patriotism to a chiefly corporate celebration has been fitful, to say the least. “I’m trying to get a better sense of how that became so thoroughly lost,” Dr. Hayes-Bautista said in a phone call from Puebla, the site of the 1862 battle. “It’d be like if the Fourth of July were reduced to beer and hot dogs.” Dr. Hayes-Bautista said many Latinos specifically avoid observing the holiday, partly because of a generational forgetfulness about the holiday’s Civil War origins. Another factor: Cinco de Mayo celebrations have recently set off moments of racial insensitivity across the United States. Recent episodes have included an offensive tweet last year by former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas; a Baylor University fraternity party called “Cinco de Drinko,” which eventually got the fraternity reprimanded by the university; and a series of on-campus holiday-related incidents at the University of New Hampshire that led the university to create a racial task force. Despite the controversies, many American cities and their Mexican communities will be celebrating the day, including Portland, Ore., and Denver. Asked to imagine an improved Cinco de Mayo, Dr. Hayes-Bautista said that partying could still play a role, but that there would be greater emphasis placed on the date’s historical context. “Let’s bring it back to its roots as a civil rights and social justice commemoration,” he said."
93,2018-05-05,House of Fraser Shareholder Sports Direct Sues Over Business Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/05/business/05reuters-houseoffraser-restructuring-sports-direct.html,304," LONDON —  A minority shareholder of Britain's House of Fraser, Sports Direct, is suing the department store chain to gain access to its business plan, after House of Fraser announced a major restructuring this week. House of Fraser said on Wednesday it would close some of its stores as a condition of securing new funds from Chinese retailer C.banner, which will become the majority owner of the department store group with a 51 percent stake. Sportswear chain Sports Direct, which owns 11.1 percent of House of Fraser, said on Saturday that it had applied to London's High Court for an injunction requiring House of Fraser to provide a copy of its corporate plan and other information. ""We have been frozen out by House of Fraser. Their dealings in China are opaque, and it is blatant that we have been unfairly prejudiced,"" Sports Direct's head of strategic investments, Liam Rowley, said. A spokeswoman for House of Fraser declined to comment. C.banner, a major retailer of mid-range to premium footwear brands in China, bought famous London toy shop Hamleys in 2015. House of Fraser was founded in 1849 and has stores in 59 locations across Britain and Ireland, including London's Oxford Street. As part of the restructuring, House of Fraser has said it will seek to sell stores via a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an agreement with creditors to pay them for a fixed period while it continues trading. House of Fraser intends to launch a formal CVA proposal early next month. A source close to the company said its management met regularly with Sports Direct founder and chief executive Mike Ashley, and would give him more details about the CVA when appropriate. Sports Direct does not have a representative on House of Fraser's board. (Reporting by David Milliken; Editing by Toby Chopra and Stephen Powell)"
94,2018-05-05,"Rescue Workers in Poland Located 3rd Coal Miner, 4 Missing",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/05/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-coal-mine.html,438," WARSAW, Poland —  Rescuers have located a third miner out of seven who went missing after an earthquake struck a coal mine Saturday in southern Poland, a mining official said. Two were rescued earlier with non-life threatening injuries. Daniel Ozon, head of the Jastrzebie Coal Company, said they can see the third miner and have contact with him, but they still need to reach him. Four miners have yet to be located. More than 200 rescuers and support teams were working through the rubble and pumping air to the search area to find the missing miners, Ozon said. The rescue operation was launched at 11:25 a.m. Saturday after a temblor occurred at the Zofiowka coal mine, said Katarzyna Jablonska-Bajer of the coal company. The mine is located in the southern town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj near Poland's border with the Czech Republic. Jablonska-Bajer said four miners were quickly brought to the surface but contact was lost with seven others who were 900 meters (2,950 feet) underground, preparing a new corridor for extraction work. Poland's State Mining Authority said the temblor had a magnitude of 3.4, while the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre pegged it at 4.3. TVN24 said the quake was also felt on the surface and shook some houses. ""There has never been such a powerful quake at the mine,"" Jablonska-Bajer said. High methane levels in the mine delayed rescuers from trying to reach the accident site for several hours. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who arrived at the mine Saturday night, said the rescuers were working non-stop and using the best equipment to reach the missing miners but they were running into blocks of rubble. ""We are doing everything to save the miners,"" he told reporters. Miners' relatives gathered in front of the mine Saturday waiting for the latest information, while the families of the missing were brought into the building. Coal mining is a major industry in Poland. Coal remains the main source of energy and heating in the country but Poland is taking some steps to shift toward renewable, cleaner sources of energy. The Main Statistical Office said some 65.8 million metric tons (58.7 million tonnes) of coal were extracted last year in Poland, some 4.8 million tons less than in 2016. Many of Poland's mines are dangerous, with methane gas that has led to a number of deadly explosions and cave-ins. So far this year, four miners have been killed at different coal mines, according to the State Mining Authority. In 2016, eight miners were killed in a cave-in at the Rudna mine in Polkowice and methane explosions killed five miners at the Myslowice-Wesola mine in 2014."

""In terms of getting a lot of money into something, many billions ... that can be tougher in markets that you're unfamiliar working in. Accumulating a $6 or $8 or $10 billion position outside the United States can be very difficult. ""Charlie keeps pushing me to do more in China."" ON AMAZON.COM AND ALPHABET ""We've certainly looked that them ... the truth is, I've watched Amazon from the start and what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. If I think something is a miracle, I tend not to bet on it. Bill Gates told me early on (to look at) Google ... ""I'll miss a lot of things that I don't feel I understand well enough, and there is no penalty in investing if you don't swing at a ball that's in the strike zone, as long as you swing at something at some point ... We'll try to stay within our circle of competence, and Charlie and I generally agree on where that circle ends ... We'll try to stay within our circle of competence ... We're going to miss a lot of things."" ""I made the wrong decision on Google and Amazon."" Munger: ""I've been to Google headquarters - it looks like a kindergarten."" ON CORPORATE PROFITS ""American industry has gotten incredibly more profitable in aggregate in the last 20-30 years ... This has become somewhat an asset-light economy ... It is a changing world and (the biggest companies) will earn even more money with the tax rate going down."" ON BERKSHIRE'S COMPANY CULTURE ""I've been on 19 boards, and I've never seen a board like ours ... It's a group of owner-oriented, Berkshire-conscious, business-savvy owners ... People opt into it to a great deal."" ON APPLE'S CASH HOARD ""It's extremely hard to find acquisitions that would be accretive to Apple (in) the $50-$100 billion range. As I look around the horizon, I don't see anything that would make sense for them, whereas I do see a business that they know everything about ... I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares ... Mentally, you can say we own 5 percent of it ... Over the passage of time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares."" ON BNSF RAILROAD ""We get a decent return on the capital-intensive businesses. We bought most at decent prices and they've been run very well."" ON NEWSPAPERS No one except the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and (now) the Washington Post has come up with a digital product that will in a significant way replace the revenue being lost as print newspapers lose cir and advertising ... the Journal, the Times and probably the Post have an economically viable model in the digital world."" ""Where the daily newspaper was a primary (source of information), they're no longer primary."" ON U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM ""This country really, really works ... this country has six times the per capita GDP growth that it had when I was born ... this is a remarkable, remarkable country ... I would love to be a baby born in the United States today."" ON CRYPTOCURRENCIES BEING A BUBBLE ""(They're) non-productive assets. It essentially will not deliver anything other than supposed scarcity. What does it produce itself? ... Anytime you buy non-productive assets, you are counting on someone later on buying a non-productive asset. It does come to a bad ending ... cryptocurrencies will come to  bad endings."" ON REINSURANCE ""We will be in the reinsurance business 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now ... It will be subject to more ups and downs than something like Geico ... but it will be an important part of Berkshire."" ON WELLS FARGO SCANDAL ""Wells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives, and it's just that they just had the wrong incentives ... The fact that you are going to have problems at some large institutions is not unique ... I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company ... going forward is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes. We have a large unrealized gain (in the stock). I like it as an investment. (The CEO) is correcting mistakes made by other people."" ON MEASURING EFFECT OF TAX CUTS ""It's very, very difficult in economics to measure the impact of single variables. Every question you get in economics, you should then say, 'And then what?'"" ON HEALTHCARE PARTNERSHIP WITH JPMORGAN AND AMAZON.COM ""We simply have three organizations with leaders I admire and trust ... We have a hugely non-competitive medical cost in American business relating to any country in the world ... The motivations are not primarily profit making. We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost .... we know the resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail - at least we tried. I think we'll probably have a CEO within a couple of months."" ON GE INVESTMENT IN 2008 ""We probably could've extracted better terms. It might have been counterproductive in the end ... We could have made better purchases 3-4 months later. We didn't push it to the limit."" ON USING CASH FOR A SPECIAL DIVIDEND ""We had a vote on whether people wanted a dividend ... the B-shares voted 47-1 against it. They expect us to do whatever we think makes sense for all shareholders, and if we thought we can't use the money effectively in the business, we should get it out ... We won't always be in a world of low interest rates or high private-market prices ... It's very unlikely we'd pay out a big special dividend."" ON PRICING RISK ""The kind of risk that you can't really look up in a book and see actuarially, I enjoy thinking through the pricing of that."" ON INFLATION ""Long-term bonds are a terrible investment at current rates, or anything close to current rates. Rates (on short-term bills) have gone up lately, so in 2018 my guess is we'll have at least $500 million (more) in pre-tax income than we had last year."" ON DEALS ""I do not worry about the slowing deal flow. My phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals but we will still be the first (point) of call, irrespective of me or Charlie not being there."" ON INVESTING IN GUN MANUFACTURERS ""I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses."" ON KRAFT HEINZ ""The 3G people have gone into certain situations where there were probably ... A lot of expenses that were not delivering a dollar of value for a dollar expended. They made changes very fast to a situation that probably shouldn't have existed in the first place."" ""Our managers have different techniques of keeping track of trying to maximize customer satisfaction at the same time that they don't incur other than necessary costs."" ""Consumer packaged goods are still a terrific business."" ON GEICO ""The growth did slow down, but it’s not because we wanted it to. If you look at the first quarter, our margins were around 7 percent, which is actually a little more than we aimed for. The underwriting gains for margins are perfectly satisfactory now. And we’ve gained market share here and market share there. We will keep gaining market share. ""Geico is a jewel. It’s an incredible company. It’s saving its customers probably $4-5 billion a year against what they would be paying otherwise.” ON PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S PROPOSED TARIFFS BUFFETT: ""We've seen steel costs increase somewhat. I don't think either (the U.S. or China) will dig themselves into something that precipitates and continues any real trade war ... The benefits of trade are basically not visible. No one thinks about benefits day by day ... The negatives, and there are negatives, are very apparent and very painful."" MUNGER: ""The conditions in steel were almost unbelievably adverse to the American steel industry. Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff."" ON CHINA-U.S. TRADE ""In August, I will be 88, in a year that ends in an 8. Eight is a lucky number in China. ... The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways for a long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests and like any two big economic entities there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades."" ON BERKSHIRE IN 50 YEARS ""I think the reputation of Berkshire being a good home for companies ... I don't think that's dependent on me and Charlie."" ""The answer is I don't know, and I didn't know what it would look like 50 years ago ... We will be as shareholder-oriented as any large company in the world. Who knows what will be happening then."" ON DURACELL BATTERIES ""Duracell should be earning more money than it is now ... The brand is strong, very strong, the product line is very strong ... From a profit standpoint, it's underperforming."" ON GROCERY STORES ""(McLane) is a very, very tight-margin business ... our competitors aren't making much money either."" ON PRECISION CASTPARTS ""It's a very, very good business. Manufacturers are very dependent on both the quality of the parts and the promptness of the delivery. Reliability ... is enormously important. (Our) contracts extend out many years ... it's an acquisition with very long tails. Mark Donegan is a fabulous manager, I wouldn’t have bought it without him in charge… it’s got very long tails to the products that are being developed."" MUNGER ON BUFFETT BEING 'SEMI-RETIRED' “He sits around reading most of the time and thinking, and every once in a while he talks on the phone. I can’t see any difference … Warren is very good at doing nothing."" (Compiled by Nick Zieminski and Jennifer Ablan in New York; Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha)"
96,2018-05-05,"How Michael Cohen, Trump’s Fixer, Built a Shadowy Business Empire",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/michael-cohen-lawyer-trump.html,4114," He was a personal-injury lawyer who often worked out of taxi offices scattered around New York City. There was the one above the run-down auto repair garage on West 16th Street in Manhattan, on the edge of the Meatpacking District before it turned trendy. There was the single-story building with the garish yellow awning in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. There was the tan brick place on a scruffy Manhattan side street often choked with double-parked taxis. And then there was his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue, right next to the one belonging to Donald J. Trump. Before he joined the Trump Organization and became Mr. Trump’s lawyer and do-it-all fixer, Michael D. Cohen was a hard-edge personal-injury attorney and businessman. Now a significant portion of his quarter-century business record is under the microscope of federal prosecutors — posing a potential threat not just to Mr. Cohen but also to the president. Mr. Cohen’s businesses are private entities, making it difficult to get a full picture of their finances and operations. But a New York Times review of thousands of pages of public records, and interviews with bankers, lawyers and businessmen who have interacted with Mr. Cohen, reveal the degree to which he has often operated in the backwaters of the financial and legal worlds. While he has not been charged with a crime, many of his associates have faced either criminal charges or stiff regulatory penalties. That includes partners in the taxi business, doctors for whom he helped establish medical clinics and lawyers with whom he worked. He has spent much of his personal and professional life with immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. His father-in-law, who helped establish him in the taxi business, was born in Ukraine, as was one of Mr. Cohen’s partners in that industry. Another partner was Russian. And Mr. Cohen used his connections in the region when scouting business opportunities for Mr. Trump in former Soviet republics. More recently, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law lent more than $25 million to a Ukrainian businessman who has a checkered financial record and a history of defaulting on loans. And Mr. Cohen long held a small stake in his uncle’s catering hall, which was frequented by Russian and Italian mobsters. In addition to his legal and taxi businesses, Mr. Cohen has had a seemingly charmed touch as a real estate investor. On one day in 2014, he sold four buildings in Manhattan for $32 million, entirely in cash. That was nearly three times what he paid for them no more than three years earlier. “This is the type of person you’d see most bankers steer clear of,” said Ben Berzin, a retired executive vice president and senior credit officer at PNC Bank who clashed with Mr. Trump in the early 1990s over loans to the future president’s troubled Atlantic City casinos. The speed with which Mr. Cohen successfully flipped real estate stands out, Mr. Berzin said. “You have to ask what’s going on.” Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, had already been examining Mr. Cohen’s conduct as part of his ongoing inquiry. Last month, federal agents executed search warrants at Mr. Cohen’s home, his office and a hotel room where he was staying. The warrants sought documents related to Mr. Cohen’s business associates, among other things. That investigation, being conducted by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, is apparently based on information provided by Mr. Mueller’s team. Mr. Trump’s lawyers are resigned to the strong possibility that the investigation of Mr. Cohen’s businesses could lead him to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Mr. Cohen, after being sent a detailed list of questions about his business interests, responded in a text message, “You need to do real fact checking as your questions are totally inaccurate.” Neither he nor his lawyers have offered further comment. Mr. Trump, for his part, has said that Mr. Cohen was “a good guy” and that federal investigators were “looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.” But the president has long entrusted Mr. Cohen to represent him in matters both public and deeply private: real estate negotiations from Fresno, Calif., to the Republic of Georgia, and the hush-money payment to an adult-film actress who said she had had an affair with the future president. Or, as Mr. Trump put it, “this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.” The $130,000 payment to the actress is in a way emblematic of Mr. Cohen’s many business dealings. Its provenance is murky, obfuscated by a private agreement, pseudonyms and evolving explanations. President Trump said this past week that he had paid Mr. Cohen a retainer that was used to reimburse the $130,000, directly contradicting his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Daniels. Within the Trump Organization, it was Mr. Cohen’s job to deal with Mr. Trump’s thorniest problems. But now, whatever problems investigators find in Mr. Cohen’s own array of businesses could double back on Mr. Trump. The son of a Holocaust survivor, Mr. Cohen grew up in the Five Towns area of Long Island, just east of the New York City borough of Queens. It was a comfortable life — both his father and an uncle were doctors, and he attended a local private school then called Woodmere Academy. “My cousins are all either lawyers or doctors,” Mr. Cohen told The New York Times last year. One of those relatives was his uncle Dr. Morton W. Levine. Uncle Morty, as he was known to his family, had no children of his own, and he and Mr. Cohen were close. He even let his nephew drive his Bentley. Dr. Levine, a family practitioner, provided medical assistance to members of the Lucchese crime family, “which aided their illegal activities,” according to a sworn affidavit in 1993 from an F.B.I. special agent. The agent was involved in the investigation of the Lucchese underboss, Anthony (Gaspipe) Casso, who “regarded Levine as someone who would do anything for him,” according to the affidavit. That account was buttressed by testimony from a longtime Lucchese associate in an unrelated 2006 federal trial. In 1992, Dr. Levine bought Mr. Casso’s home while Mr. Casso was a fugitive. Dr. Levine has acknowledged in court documents that Mr. Casso was a patient. But he said he did not know that the house belonged to Mr. Casso and denied any wrongdoing. Dr. Levine also owned El Caribe, a Brooklyn catering hall that for decades was the scene of mob weddings and Christmas parties. Two of New York’s most notorious Russian mobsters once maintained offices there. Mr. Cohen was among the minority owners of El Caribe, Dr. Levine has said, although he added that Mr. Cohen gave up his ownership stake after the 2016 election. Dr. Levine had crossed paths with Mr. Trump years before his nephew went to work for him. The doctor was part of an investment group with some garment executives that unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Trump’s 1989 bid for the Atlantis Casino in Atlantic City. Dr. Levine declined to comment. Mr. Cohen began his professional legal career at a personal injury firm in 1992, the year after he graduated from Cooley Law School in Michigan. His boss at that first job would later plead guilty to bribery. Mr. Cohen’s marriage in 1994 gave him entree to communities of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His new father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, had emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. By the time of the wedding, Mr. Shusterman had landed in serious legal trouble. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. Mr. Shusterman cooperated with prosecutors in a related case and was sentenced to probation. In the years after his marriage, Mr. Cohen began doing business with Ukrainian and Russian immigrants. They hailed from New York, Chicago and Florida, in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles, known as the Russian Riviera, communities through which a vein of organized crime ran. In 1999, Mr. Cohen would find himself in the middle of a Sunny Isles real estate deal involving a hockey player and a purported figure from the Russian underworld. Nearly 20 years later, the details of the transaction remain unclear, but Mr. Cohen received a check for $350,000 from a Russian player for the Montreal Canadiens that was part of a deal involving an apartment in Sunny Isles. The player’s agent later testified that the money was intended to go to Vitaly Buslaev. Mr. Buslaev, who has been identified by multiple Russian media outlets as a Mafia figure, was a friend of one of Mr. Cohen’s business partners, according to two people who knew both men. Mr. Cohen said in an interview last year that he did not know Mr. Buslaev. He declined to identify the person to whom he sent the $350,000, saying only that he had honored the athlete’s request. “The money went to where it was directed to go,” he said. Mr. Cohen’s ventures with business partners from the former Soviet Union continued, including a 2003 investment in a Florida casino boat with several Ukrainian immigrants that failed. After that, he helped members of his own family set up an ethanol production business in Ukraine. It was through his wife’s family that Mr. Cohen would be introduced to the taxi business, which would ultimately allow him to pull in millions of dollars. Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, initially found work as a taxi driver after arriving in the United States. By 1993, he accumulated nine taxi medallions — the coveted metal placards that permit people to own or operate cabs — then worth roughly $1.5 million. Mr. Shusterman circulated among his fellow taxi operators, trying to help Mr. Cohen find work. He introduced his son-in-law to Ilya Palinsky, a longtime fixture in the business. Mr. Palinsky said his impression of Mr. Cohen was that “he talks a lot, screams, you know. He’s a hyper guy.” Not long afterward, Mr. Cohen began building his own taxi business, even as he was taking on personal injury work as a lawyer. He partnered with Symon Garber, another Ukrainian-born businessman, who was borrowing large amounts of money to finance taxi businesses in both Russia and the United States. A lawyer for the two men said in a court filing that he had helped them lay the groundwork for a planned taxi business in Moscow in the mid-1990s, although it never materialized. Mr. Cohen borrowed from a half-dozen banks and credit unions to buy taxi medallions. Then he used the medallions as collateral to borrow more money to buy more medallions, former colleagues said. He quickly amassed 30 medallions, each then worth about $250,000, but racked up millions in debt. Together, the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some for other owners. Drivers paid them $100 a shift. Millions of dollars in cash flowed in. Mr. Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holster. In 2007, Mr. Cohen started working for the Trump Organization. While there are varying accounts of how he met his new boss, Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen appeared on his radar after he began buying up properties in Trump buildings — by then, Mr. Cohen’s office addresses included tony Fifth Avenue locations. For his part, Mr. Cohen has said that the job came after he helped resolve a board dispute at one of the Trump buildings where his family owned several units. Mr. Cohen became a roving fixer for Mr. Trump. In his first year on the job, he and Ivanka Trump kicked the tires on a potential golf course development project in Fresno, Calif. A year later, he was named chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a mixed martial arts venture that Mr. Trump had started. Mr. Cohen traveled to the former Soviet bloc on Mr. Trump’s behalf, visiting Georgia in 2010. He even scouted out Iowa for Mr. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential campaign and set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org. During Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr. Cohen, who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr. Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen worked with Mr. Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed. (Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.) While juggling his Trump duties, Mr. Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr. Garber in 2006 and received as much as $1 million per year, legal records show. After a falling-out with Mr. Garber, Mr. Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, an immigrant from St. Petersburg, Russia, who had assembled a large taxi fleet. Both of Mr. Cohen’s taxi partners had a history of legal run-ins. Each has been made to pay more than $1 million for overcharging their drivers, according to the New York State attorney general. Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures, stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection efforts. The Chicago authorities found that Mr. Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city; he agreed to pay a fine of nearly $1 million. In 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. Last April, New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions. He currently is awaiting trial in Albany on charges he failed to pay $5 million in taxes. Despite the prohibition issued by city regulators, Mr. Freidman is still managing Mr. Cohen’s medallions, both men have said. “Cohen associated himself with the most reckless and greedy players in the industry,” said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents cabdrivers. “They have simultaneously worked to inflate the value of their medallions and rip off their drivers.” Patrick J. Egan, a lawyer for Mr. Freidman, said his client denies all the allegations against him. Mr. Freidman, he said, has been the victim of “fabricated claims” by former colleagues and politically motivated prosecutors. Mr. Garber did not respond to requests for comment. From 2009 to 2014, Mr. Cohen — by then a trusted member of the Trump Organization — plowed $5.7 million into 22 Chicago taxi medallions, records show. The investments were ill timed. The ascent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions. Since 2014, Mr. Cohen’s companies have been falling behind on taxes. Over all, his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than $375,000 for a variety of tax, insurance and inspection problems, according to records. Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspended. But even as the industry has buckled, Mr. Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money. In December 2014, with his medallions worth $35 million, he took out loans totaling at least $20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union, according to a banker who reviewed the transactions. (Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrants.) In 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear. The financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed. On April 24, Mr. Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans. The transactions, with Sterling National Bank, appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years, according to public filings on the refinanced loans. And they added a new, unusual source of collateral: If Mr. Cohen were to default, Sterling would have the right to any money that Mr. Freidman owes Mr. Cohen. Many of Mr. Freidman’s taxi companies have declared bankruptcy. Asked about the loans, Mr. Freidman’s lawyer said his client had “no assets” that could be used as collateral. Spokesmen for Sterling and Melrose declined to comment. It was unclear what Mr. Cohen has done with all the money he has borrowed in recent years. But he received some of the funds around the time that he and his father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, lent a combined $26 million to a Ukrainian immigrant and taxi-fleet operator named Semyon Shtayner, real estate records show. The transactions were unusual: Mr. Shtayner has had nearly $1.7 million in judgments and liens against him over the years, yet Mr. Cohen made large loans backed by collateral that appears to be worth less than the value of the loans. Since 2012, Mr. Cohen has lent $6 million to Mr. Shtayner, whose family owns Chicago Medallion Management Corporation, which manages more than 300 cabs in that city — including those owned by Mr. Cohen. The only collateral on the loans appears to be the Shtayners’ condominium in Sunny Isles, purchased in 2009 for $2.35 million. Nevertheless, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law were willing lenders to Mr. Shtayner, who recently entered the marijuana cultivation business in Nevada. Since last summer, Mr. Shusterman has lent $20 million to Mr. Shtayner’s wife, Yasya, and two limited liability companies she controls. “This is a business exchange, that’s it,” Yasya Shtayner said in a brief phone interview, when questioned about the loans from Mr. Cohen. Asked whether she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf, she said yes. Then she hung up. After he had built a taxi operation and a personal injury legal practice, there was another element to Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, this one involving doctors and companies that operated on the fringes of the medical field. Starting in 2000, Mr. Cohen set up a series of companies in New York City. There were two medical practices, an acupuncture office, two medical billing companies, two management companies and a transportation company. The ventures were noteworthy, in part, because they were created at a time when countless phony companies were cropping up to exploit so-called no-fault auto insurance laws in New York and other states. Hundreds of doctors, businesses owners and others would eventually be criminally charged or accused of fraud by insurance companies. There is no evidence that Mr. Cohen or the companies he created were part of such schemes. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Cohen did anything other than register the companies with state authorities. The no-fault insurance schemes, which were often masterminded by organized crime figures from the former Soviet Union, all followed a basic template. Staged or exaggerated car accidents were used to generate a tidal wave of “patients.” Transportation companies then took the patients — often low-level criminals — to what in many instances were sham medical clinics, diagnostic testing offices, and acupuncture and physical therapy offices. Billing companies were created to collect money from insurers, and management companies then siphoned the funds out to the scheme’s operators. Some operators were so bold that they sued insurers that had stopped paying after they realized they were being defrauded. Mr. Cohen’s role, if any, in the operation of the companies he helped set up was unclear. The only people listed in the incorporation papers as having roles in the businesses are the two doctors, Aleksandr Martirosov and Zhanna Kanevsky, who were each affiliated with a medical practice. But both of those doctors were accused of insurance fraud in connection with different medical practices they operated. Dr. Martirosov was arrested and charged with insurance fraud and grand larceny in 2003. A little more than a year earlier, Mr. Cohen had registered Avex Medical Care in Dr. Martirosov’s name. In 2005, Dr. Kanevsky was indicted on state racketeering charges, the result of a lengthy wiretap investigation into phony accidents and medical claims. Mr. Cohen had registered Life Quality Medical Care on Dr. Kanevsky’s behalf in April 2002. Dr. Kanevsky pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud in the second degree. A man who answered two phone numbers listed in her name said “no comment” and hung up. The charges against Dr. Martirosov were later dropped. He did not respond to calls for comment or a message left at his home. The same year he was arrested, Dr. Martirosov was named in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by the insurance company Allstate, in connection with his work for another medical business. The suit accused dozens of doctors and business owners of trying to defraud insurers. Dr. Martirosov denied wrongdoing. Avex Medical Care continued to operate after Dr. Martirosov’s arrest. The company later sued insurers at a frenetic pace that averaged almost one lawsuit a week from 2003 to 2008. The suits targeted insurers that had balked at paying for treatments for accident victims. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Cohen’s personal injury practice filed hundreds of lawsuits largely stemming from auto accidents. For part of that time, a bustling bullpen of clerks and paralegals worked the phones at his Long Island City office. They sought settlements with insurers and churned out suits on behalf of clients, many of whom were referred to clinics that were later caught up in no-fault insurance fraud investigations. One of the personal injury lawsuits that Mr. Cohen filed was in connection to a 1999 auto accident in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. Both his client and the defendant were later indicted on insurance fraud charges related to the accident, Rolling Stone recently reported. The lawsuit filed by Mr. Cohen was dropped. During his time working at the Trump Organization, Mr. Cohen became a minor real estate baron in his own right. While his business is dwarfed by Mr. Trump’s assemblage of properties, it is not insignificant. From 2011 to 2015, limited liability companies connected to Mr. Cohen purchased at least five buildings in Manhattan, public records show. Like many of Mr. Cohen’s business dealings, the transactions were unconventional. His companies would buy a building, often in cash. Soon after, they would flip the building in another all-cash deal for four or five times the previous purchase price. The buyer was generally another limited liability company. In October 2011, for example, a limited liability company listing as its address Mr. Cohen’s apartment at Trump Park Avenue purchased a building on Rivington Street on Manhattan’s Lower East Side for $2.1 million. In 2014, Mr. Cohen sold the building for $10 million in cash — nearly five times what he paid three years earlier. That same day, Mr. Cohen sold three other Manhattan buildings, also entirely for cash. In total, the four buildings sold for $32 million — nearly triple what Mr. Cohen had paid for them in the span of no more than three years. It is not known who owns the limited liability companies that purchased the properties from Mr. Cohen or why they agreed to pay such rich prices. Mr. Cohen told McClatchy, which first reported the transactions, that the sales were in cash to help the buyers defer taxes in other transactions. Richard K. Gordon, director of the Financial Integrity Institute at Case Western Reserve University’s law school, said that such real estate transactions — large profits, achieved quickly, involving cash purchases by L.L.C.s — should raise red flags. “If I were the bank, I’d either refuse his business up front or rate him extra high risk,” said Mr. Gordon, who once led anti-money-laundering efforts for the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Trump is closely monitoring the investigations into his longtime counselor. In recent weeks, he has moved to simultaneously embrace Mr. Cohen and keep him at arm’s length. “Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month. “Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that.” A few days later, Mr. Trump asserted that the investigation was unrelated to Mr. Cohen’s work for him. “From what I understand, they’re looking at his businesses,” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been told I’m not involved.” The president added: “I hope he’s in great shape.”"
97,2018-05-05,Amazon Unsuccessfully Approached UK Supermarket Waitrose in 2017: Sunday Times,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/05/business/05reuters-amazon-com-waitrose.html,186," LONDON —  Amazon made an unsuccessful informal attempt to buy upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose late last year, the Sunday Times newspaper reported. Citing an unidentified source, the newspaper said Amazon's vice president of special projects, Ajay Kavan, approached an unnamed director of John Lewis Partnership, the department store-led retail group of which Waitrose is part. One director had several ""enormously informal"" discussions with Amazon in November but John Lewis's chairman, Charlie Mayfield, refused to discuss a tie-up further, the newspaper said. The paper also quoted Mayfield denying on Saturday that there had been an approach. ""These times are ripe for speculation, but there has been no approach to the partnership by Amazon regarding Waitrose, and nor would I expect there to be,"" Mayfield said. Britain's retail sector was rocked last week when it emerged that Sainsbury's was seeking to take control of Walmart's Asda unit for around 7.3 billion pounds ($10 billion), a move that will create Britain's biggest supermarket if approved by regulators. Amazon bought Whole Foods, an upmarket U.S.-focused supermarket, for $13.4 billion in mid-2017. (Reporting by David Milliken; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"
98,2018-05-05,Xerox Appeals Decision Blocking Fujifilm Deal as CEO Returns,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/05/business/05reuters-xerox-m-a-fujifilm.html,670," (Reuters) - Xerox Corp on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings, just hours after the company announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place. Xerox said its entire board and management team would stay, as the agreement to oust them reached with dissenting shareholders Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn expired late Thursday. ""With the caveat that I have not been privy to these negotiations, I find the rejection of the settlement by the Xerox board to be extraordinary and highly unusual,"" said Guhan Subramanian, a professor at Harvard's law and business schools who served as an expert witness for Xerox in the litigation. Officially, Xerox and the activists said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement ahead of a self-imposed deadline Thursday evening. A source familiar with the matter said Xerox's board let the settlement expire because it came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm. Xerox's board also took into account that the company's shares had fallen more than 10 percent since it announced its settlement with the activists. The judge said in a hearing on May 3 that he was not prohibiting Xerox from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm, according to a court transcript. In fact, Xerox has already started renegotiating its deal with Fujifilm, according to the source, who did not want to be identified because the matter is private. The companies are discussing adding $5 a share to the $2.5 billion special cash dividend of roughly $9.80 per share that Xerox shareholders would receive as part of the deal, the person said. The two companies could also come up with a new structure all together, the person added. Fujifilm declined to comment on the negotiations on Friday, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Xerox shares closed little changed at $28.38 per share on Friday. AMMUNITION FOR ACTIVISTS? Xerox and Fujifilm agreed in late January to a $6.1 billion deal that would merge the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm. A New York court temporarily blocked the transaction last week, saying that Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson was ""hopelessly conflicted"" and that he sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations. In its appeal on Friday, Xerox disputed the court's findings that the board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the deal and said the board unanimously authorized the deal. Meanwhile, Deason and Icahn, who own about 15 percent of the company, have vowed to keep fighting Xerox, and will nominate a slate of directors at the company's upcoming annual board meeting. Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at University of Delaware, said the confusing turn of events at Xerox ""give the activists more ammunition"" in a proxy fight. Deason and Icahn have argued that Xerox's board acted in a self-interested fashion and failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company. Xerox's board has also been exploring its options. Reuters previously reported that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has approached Xerox to express interest in a possible acquisition. Fujifilm, which had objected to the settlement between Xerox and the activists, said it was satisfied that Xerox had not settled with the activists this week. Fujifilm is also planning to appeal last week's court order and said in a statement on Friday that Xerox shareholders should decide for themselves the merits of any deal. But a deal under new terms between Fujifilm and Xerox is far from certain. Fujifilm shares have been falling since the deal announcement in late January as investors have been questioning the benefits of the deal. (Reporting by Liana B.

99,2018-05-06,2 Found Dead in Quake-Hit Polish Coal Mine; 3 Still Missing,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/06/world/europe/ap-eu-poland-coal-mine.html,446," WARSAW, Poland —  Polish rescue workers on Sunday found the bodies of two miners after an earthquake hit a coal mine in southern Poland. Three other miners remain missing some 900 meters (2,950 feet) below ground since the quake hit Saturday morning in the mine, located in the town of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, close to Poland's border with the Czech Republic. The head of the Jastrzebie Coal Company, Daniel Ozon, said a doctor confirmed the two fatalities and identification of the victims was underway. The first victim, initially identified by Ozon as a 38-year-old man, had been trapped under some metal. Ozon said the identification still needed to be confirmed by DNA tests. The second miner was found a few hours later, trapped in the rubble, he added. More than 200 workers were involved in the rescue operation, working through twisted machinery and metal parts to get to the area where they expect to find the missing men. Ozon said emergency workers were pumping air into the affected area to lower the level of methane gas before they can safely move ahead. A minor quake Sunday afternoon briefly delayed rescue efforts as it released more methane into the search area, Ozon said. After the quake hit, four miners were rescued quickly but seven others went missing. Two of the missing were later found alive and have been hospitalized. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda travelled to the town, visiting the hospitalized miners and meeting with their families and some of the rescuers. Duda extended his condolences to the victims' families. Authorities have launched an investigation into the accident. It was not clear if coal extraction would resume Monday. Poland's State Mining Authority said the temblor had a magnitude of 3.4, while the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre pegged it at 4.3. TVN24 said the quake was also felt on the surface and shook some houses. Coal mining is a major industry in Poland. Coal remains the main source of energy and heating in the country but Poland is taking some steps to shift toward renewable, cleaner sources of energy. The Main Statistical Office said some 65.8 million metric tons (58.7 million tonnes) of coal were extracted last year in Poland, some 4.8 million tons less than in 2016. Still many of Poland's mines are dangerous, with methane gas that has led to a number of deadly explosions and cave-ins. So far this year, six miners including Sunday's casualties have been killed at different mines, according to the State Mining Authority. In 2016, eight miners were killed in a cave-in at the Rudna mine in Polkowice and methane explosions killed five miners at the Myslowice-Wesola mine in 2014."
100,2018-05-06,An Urgent Debate for California Republicans: How to Get Back in the Game,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/us/california-republicans.html,1736," WHITTIER, Calif. — For anyone wondering about the state of the Republican Party in California these days, consider this: There may be no Republican candidate for governor or United States senator on the state’s ballot this November. That dispiriting possibility is beginning to sink in for California Republicans, against the backdrop of a divisive debate among its candidates and leaders on how the embattled party can become competitive again in a state where Ronald Reagan was elected twice as governor and that Richard M. Nixon called home. It’s no secret the state’s Republican Party has been in a decline for 20 years. Its challenges have been aggravated by the election of President Trump, as he has pushed tougher policies on such issues as immigration and the environment, running up against strong and often bipartisan sentiment in California. A field of Republican candidates for the United States Senate and governor is struggling against these headwinds as they seek to end a more than 10-year drought and elect a party member to statewide office. Under the California election system, candidates compete in an open, nonpartisan primary on June 5. The two candidates who get the most votes — regardless of party — advance to the November general election. If Republicans fall short in capturing one of those two November slots next month, which members of both parties say is a strong possibility, it would apparently be the first election since 1914 where a major party had no candidate in either the race for senator or for governor. Republican hopes of getting a spot on the November ballot suffered another setback on Sunday when party leaders, meeting in San Diego, failed to agree on anyone to endorse in the June primary. “Maybe hitting rock bottom is getting shut out of both state races this year,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor. “You would think that if Republicans are shut out, it will be time for some serious soul-searching.” The party, if far from the dominant power it was once in California, is still a force. Two of the most powerful Republican members of the congressional leadership represent central California: Kevin McCarthy, a close ally of Mr. Trump, who is in line to become the next speaker should Republicans hold the House this November, and Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House intelligence committee. Both are popular in their districts and wield plenty of influence in Washington. There are pockets of Republican strength across the state — in Northern California, the Central Valley and some suburbs — a remnant of when it was dominant statewide. But the Republican Party holds no statewide offices. Democrats control both houses of the State Legislature. Party registration is on the decline. And one of the potential Republican candidates for Senate who some polls suggest has at least a theoretical shot of making it to the November ballot is Patrick Little, an extremist who has called for the country to be “free from Jews.” There have been hard-line strains in the California Republican Party for years, centered around law and order, taxes and immigration issues. But this is also a state with a moderate wing. A group of Republicans led by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor, and Chad Mayes, the former Republican Assembly leader, have begun a campaign to move the party to the center, arguing that would make it more competitive by increasing its appeal to independent voters and disaffected Democrats. But that effort has run up against Republican candidates and elected officials who have tied their success to Mr. Trump and his administration’s policies. “Arnold Schwarzenegger and Republicans like Mayes are completely wrong,” Travis Allen, a Republican candidate for governor and member of the Assembly, said in an interview. “Californian Republicans need to stand up for common sense and the rule of law and the fiscal conservatism that has been sorely lacking in our state for decades. Mayes and Schwarzenegger have done a disservice to every Californian who believes in limited government, respect for the rule of law and fiscal sanity.” “This is why Republicans have been losing for decades in California,” he said. “These so-called Republican-lites that are pandering to Democrat policies and politicians are why Californians are now registering as decline-to-state in ever-increasing numbers.” Indeed, the moderate political line being advocated by Mr. Schwarzenegger and Mr. Mayes is not reflected by any of the limited number of viable Republican candidates for statewide office. The division over the future of the party was on full display the other night at a forum sponsored by the North Orange County Republican Women’s Federated Dinner for Mr. Allen and another Republican candidate for governor, John Cox, a businessman — the only two Republicans in a very crowded field who appear to have a chance to capture one of the top two spots in the primary. “Raise your hand if you voted for Donald Trump,” Mr. Allen said from the stage as most of the hands went up. “In 2016 we took back our country. In 2018 we are taking back California.” A few moments later, both candidates told the moderator that they firmly supported Mr. Trump’s call to build a wall along the Mexican border. “A border wall should not be controversial at all,” Mr. Cox said. “That should be the No. 1 thing we do. We have a country to the south of us that is relatively ungoverned now.” “I support the president, by the way, 100 percent,” he said. “I’m glad he’s president.” Mr. Mayes, who was ousted as the Republican leader of the State Assembly after he negotiated a Republican vote-delivering compromise with Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, on legislation to curb greenhouse emissions, said that sentiment threatened to further distance the party from voters. “We went from having an approach under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush where we loved and cared about people and we went out of our way to make people’s lives were better to this ‘us versus them’ mentality,” he said. “We have to stop making excuses for not winning in California,” Mr. Mayes added. “We need to come to grips with reality and understand the electorate in California has changed. We have to go to them. We are not going to win elections until we figure that out.” But many Republicans echo the concerns being expressed by candidates this campaign season about immigration, as well as their support for Mr. Trump. Jim de Martini, a farmer and local Republican county leader in Stanislaus County, said he thought the president and his policies — on the economy, immigration and foreign policy — would resonate for voters here. “He’s done a great job on the economy,” he said. “Tax cuts. Promoting business.” Mr. de Martini, reflecting what has historically been a source of Republican strength in the state, said the party should be focusing as well on what he described as overspending and overregulation by Democrats who control the state government. “The economy is always the big issue because the state of California has been irresponsible in its budget, bankrupting the state, and overregulating,” he said. “It is destroying the state.” The prospect that there may be no Republican candidate for Senate or governor this November casts both short-term and long-term threats for the party. For this election, it could complicate efforts to draw Republicans to the polls in a year when Democrats are looking to oust as many as seven endangered Republican members of Congress. To try to counter that, Republicans, including Mr. McCarthy, are pushing an initiative for the November ballot to repeal a gasoline tax instituted by Democrats in the Legislature last year. For the long term, it is a reminder of just how little influence the party has statewide. Republicans failed to win a spot on the 2016 ballot for Senate as well. “It’s important that we start talking about different issues,” said Rocky Chavez, a Republican member of the Assembly who is running for a congressional seat left open by the retirement of Representative Darrell Issa of San Diego County. “The environment is an important thing in California. That’s not something Republicans always talk about.” But Mr. Chavez’s argument failed to win him the support of the San Diego County Republican Party and Mr. Issa; it instead backed Diane Harkey, a former member of the Assembly who has, like Mr. Issa, struck a more hardened conservative line. One of the key points of contention with the Republican Party in the state is immigration. It has been a complication for Republicans since California voters passed an initiative pushed by the Republican governor, Pete Wilson, in 1994 to prohibit illegal immigrants from getting state social services. That initiative, which was thrown out in court, was seen as one of the critical reasons for the party’s decline, as the Latino population in this state has continued to grow, and as California became more Democratic. Democrats make up nearly 45 percent of the total number of registered voters in the state. Republicans account for about 25 percent, just slightly ahead of the percentage of voters who declined to pick a party registration. Given the changing political and demographic tides, many Republicans have, since 1994, sought to move away from the tougher immigration positions in an effort to expand the party’s appeal. But Mr. Trump pushed immigration back to the front burner — and Democrats responded by passing so-called sanctuary state laws intended to hamper efforts by federal immigration officers. “The biggest issue is the sanctuary state thing,” said Mr. Cox, the businessman running for governor. “The politicians seem to be favoring criminals more than law-abiding citizens.” Finally, Mr. Trump himself has emerged as a critical issue as Republicans try to chart a path forward. Mr. Trump lost California by nearly four million votes, and he remains consistently unpopular overall. But he is popular with Republican primary voters, and candidates have lined up behind him. “I’m at a forum a few weeks ago and I’m listening to these Democrats ripping him up,” Mr. Cox said. “I said, ‘Donald Trump didn’t create the housing crisis. Donald Trump didn’t create a drought. Donald Trump didn’t raise your taxes to ridiculous heights. You are sitting here making Donald Trump the issue.’ The issue on the ballot in 2018 is not going to be Donald Trump.”"
101,2018-05-06,Bank of America's Loan to Remington Tests Its Firearms Pledge,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/business/06reuters-bank-of-america-remington.html,730," WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK —  Bank of America Corp is preparing to provide critical financing to Remington Outdoor Co, which makes assault-type rifles, just weeks after the U.S. bank said it would stop financing ""military-style"" firearms for civilians. The bank is contributing $43.2 million to a $193 million lending package funded by seven banks, according to court documents, which will help put Remington back on stable footing  as it emerges from bankruptcy later this month into an uncertain environment for gun makers. The package replaces a similar credit facility the banks committed to providing Remington. Both were agreed in late March, before Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, changed its policy to stop financing companies that make military-style guns for civilian use. Anne Finucane, Bank of America's vice chair, said in April that the bank had decided on its pledge to help reduce mass shootings, saying in an interview with Bloomberg TV that ""it is not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis."" The comment came weeks after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, triggered a new movement for gun control, led in part by student survivors, increasing pressure on U.S. companies to seek to distance themselves from the firearms industry. Finucane in the Bloomberg TV interview said that Bank of America was in discussions with its gun-manufacturing clients following the change, but did not give details. She did not mention Remington. Bank of America's plans to go ahead with the credit facility following its change of policy in April have not previously been reported. Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters. Representatives for Remington and Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington's private equity owner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cerberus will give up its equity stake in Remington under the weapons maker's bankruptcy plan. According to a review of bankruptcy court documents and interviews with restructuring experts, Bank of America's agreement with Remington allows it to back out and find another lender to cover its commitment. But withdrawing from the deal would hurt the bank's reputation for standing by its lending agreements and could undermine Remington's survival, according to one person familiar with the bank's thinking. Noting that the credit facility is part of a court-supervised bankruptcy, the source said that if the bank were to pull out of the deal it could expose itself to lawsuits and potential damages. Remington makes the Bushmaster assault-style rifle, including the one used in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults. At Bank of America's annual shareholder meeting in April, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the change of policy toward some gun makers was prompted in part because more than 150 Bank of America employees ""directly lost a relative in the shootings in the last couple years."" Moynihan was responding to conservative activist and shareholder Justin Danhof, who said at the meeting that the bank has an obligation to its investors to make profitable loans. ""The company is willfully giving up money,"" Danhof said of the guns pledge. Remington has been a client of Bank of America and the six other lenders providing the credit facility since at least 2012, according to court records. For the new facility, Wells Fargo & Co and Regions Bank are each providing $43.2 million, while Branch Banking and Trust Co, Synovus Bank, Fifth Third Bank and Deutsche Bank are providing smaller amounts. Wells Fargo has said it believes the government should set gun policy, not companies through their credit. The other banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. In the weeks leading up to Remington's bankruptcy, 30 other potential lenders turned down requests for help from Remington's financial adviser, many of them citing firearms as the reason, according to court documents. One corporate restructuring specialist suggested Bank of America could have used the new credit facility as leverage to demand that Remington stop making assault-style rifles. ""It's perfectly reasonable for them to say to any borrower, 'We're happy to lend to you if you don't make military-style assault weapons,'"" said Ted Gavin of the Gavin/Solmonese LLC restructuring advisory firm. ""The lender has all the power."" (Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware and Jessica DiNapoli in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Daniel Wallis and Leslie Adler)"

""We would open the Pandora's box. There could be war,"" Macron told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel. But he added: ""I don't think that Donald Trump wants war."" Trump is set to decide by May 12 whether to pull out of the Iran deal. Trump has all but decided to withdraw but exactly how he will do so remains unclear, two White House officials and a source familiar with the administration's internal debate said on May 2. Trump could still figure out a way to stay in the deal between the Islamic Republic and six world powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. Macron urged Trump not to withdraw when he met the president in Washington late last month. Britain, France and Germany remain committed to the accord but, in an effort to keep Washington in it, want to open talks on Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 - when key provisions of the deal expire - and its role in Middle East crises such as Syria and Yemen.

103,2018-05-06,Planemakers Risk Order Disruption as Etihad Reviews Strategy,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/business/06reuters-airbus-boeing-etihad-orders.html,345," DUBAI/PARIS/ABU DHABI —  Airbus and Boeing are preparing for possible changes to dozens of plane orders from Middle East carrier Etihad Airways as it presses ahead with a company-wide review, four sources familiar with the matter said. Etihad has been reviewing its business since 2016 when investments in other airlines contributed to a nearly $2 billion (1.48 billion pounds) loss for the Abu Dhabi state-owned carrier. Etihad is considering its options for over 160 aircraft it has ordered, ranging from swapping models to delaying deliveries to outright cancellations, the sources told Reuters. A final decision could be based on a combination of the three options, one source said. Etihad declined to comment. A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment, citing company policy to ""not comment on delivery schedules nor any discussions with customers"". An Airbus spokeswoman declined to comment, telling Reuters talks with customers were confidential. Few details of the review have been made public but Etihad's new Group Chief Executive Tony Douglas said on April 30 that the airline aims to develop in ""a sustainable way"". Etihad has 88 Airbus and 78 Boeing jets on order worth tens of billions of dollars, largely from deals signed in 2013, which are scheduled to start delivery from this year. The orders include 62 Airbus A350s and 52 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, according to the two planemakers' websites. The bulk of the aircraft were ordered when Etihad was pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy to keep pace with regional rivals Emirates and Qatar Airways. Etihad said then that under the agreements with Airbus and Boeing, it could transfer orders to airlines it had invested in. At that time, the airline had stakes in several other carriers. The expansion strategy seemingly collapsed last year when Air Berlin and Alitalia filed for insolvency after Etihad invested in them. Air Berlin, one of Etihad's biggest investments, ceased operations last October, while Alitalia, the most high profile, is unlikely to take any aircraft as insolvency proceedings continue. Etihad currently holds stakes in four other airlines. (Writing by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous/Keith Weir)"
104,2018-05-06,Italy's 5-Star Makes Last-Ditch Overture to League for Government,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/world/europe/06reuters-italy-politics.html,548," ROME —  The leader of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, on Sunday made a last-ditch offer to the far-right League in a bid to break a political deadlock that has dragged on for more than two months. For the first time since the March 4 vote ended with a hung parliament, Di Maio said he would pick a prime minister with League leader Matteo Salvini. Until now, Di Maio has insisted that he be the next premier. ""If the goal is to put into action an election platform and the obstacle is Luigi Di Maio as premier, then I say let's choose a prime minister together,"" Di Maio said referring to the League during an interview on RAI state television. The move came hours before a third and possibly final round of formal consultations with President Sergio Mattarella. 5-Star will meet the president at 10 a.m. Rome time (0800 GMT) on Monday, with the League leading the center-right delegation to the presidential palace an hour later. While Di Maio conceded the prime minister's office, he held his ground on insisting that Salvini abandon his ally, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who 5-Star views as a symbol of political corruption. ""The ball is now in the center-right's court,"" Di Maio added, saying he did not know if Berlusconi would take ""a step back"". Salvini, Berlusconi and Giorgia Meloni - the leaders of the center-right alliance - met for more than two hours in the evening, and agreed to see each other again in the morning before their appointment with the president. ""For now the center-right remains united, but it's not over yet,"" a senior source in Berlusconi's party said after Sunday night's talks.Salvini has repeatedly refused to break with Berlusconi over the past two months. If the alliance remains united this time, Mattarella is expected to try to put forward a stopgap government to take Italy back to a vote later this year. Di Maio said if 5-Star fails to come to an agreement with the League, he wants an election as soon as possible, as early as this summer. 5-Star will not support any government put together by Mattarella, Di Maio said. Such a short-term government could only take office with full powers if it has the support of either 5-Star or the League, and both parties have been hostile to the idea. ""A government put together by the president would not have the numbers (in parliament),"" Di Maio said. ""We cannot vote confidence in it and as far as I know, neither would the League."" Di Maio's latest offer to the League followed Salvini's proposal on Friday for the formation of a stopgap government between the center-right and 5-Star that would be tasked with writing a 2019 budget and preparing for a new election. Mattarella, who has the power to select prime ministers and dissolve parliament, has sought to avoid another vote by conducting meticulous and patient negotiations, but now a source familiar with the situation has said an election in September or October cannot be ruled out. ""I thought it would be difficult (to form a government), but I didn't think it would be impossible,"" Di Maio said.

105,2018-05-06,Rights Group Asks UAE for Whereabouts of Dubai Princess,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/world/europe/06reuters-emirates-rights-princess.html,404," DUBAI —  Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called on United Arab Emirates authorities to disclose the whereabouts and condition of a daughter of Dubai's ruler, following reports that she was forcibly returned after fleeing the Gulf Arab state. The rights group identified the daughter as Sheikha Latifa bin Mohammad al-Maktoum, 32, and said that failure to disclose her status could ""qualify as an enforced disappearance, given the evidence suggesting that she was last seen as UAE authorities were detaining her"". UAE officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. A source close to the government of Dubai told Reuters that ""Latifa is safe and sound with her family"" but declined further comment, citing legal considerations. The UAE has also yet to comment on recent media reports that Sheikha Latifa, a daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, announced in a video that she was fleeing the emirate due to restrictions imposed on her by her family. The reports said she escaped with the help of friends on a yacht owned by a Frenchman which was later intercepted off the coast of India. ""A witness told Human Rights Watch that UAE authorities intercepted Sheikha Latifa on March 4, 2018, as she tried to flee by sea to a third country, and returned her to the UAE,"" the rights group said in its statement. HRW quoted two friends of Sheikha Latifa as saying she had not been seen or heard from for two months. ""If she is detained she needs to be given the rights all detainees should have, including being taken before an independent judge,"" it said. The rights group quoted Finnish national Tiina Jauhiainen, described as a friend of Sheikha Latifa who was one of several foreigners on the boat, as saying the Indian Coast Guard participated in the raid on the vessel in coordination with UAE authorities. Jauhiainen said that on March 22 UAE authorities allowed her to return to Finland, and they allowed the yacht's owner Herve Jaubert, who holds French and American citizenship, to leave the UAE along with the boat's crew around the same time. Rights groups have criticized the UAE, a key U.S. ally and the Gulf's trading and tourism hub, of clamping down on dissent. Like most Gulf states, the UAE brooks little public criticism of ruling family members, senior officials or policy. (Reporting By Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous/Keith Weir)"
106,2018-05-06,Exclusive: Conoco Moves to Take Over Venezuelan PDVSA's Caribbean Assets-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/06/business/06reuters-conocophillips-pdvsa-assets.html,739," HOUSTON/CARACAS —  U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips has moved to take Caribbean assets of Venezuela's state-run PDVSA to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award over a decade-oil nationalization of its projects in the South American country, according to three sources familiar with its actions. The U.S. firm targeted facilities on the islands of Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius that accounted for about a quarter of Venezuela's oil exports last year. The three play key roles in processing, storing and blending PDVSA's oil for export. The company received court attachments freezing assets at least two of the facilities, and could move to sell them, one of the sources said. Conoco's legal maneuvers could further impair PDVSA's declining oil revenue and the country's convulsing economy. Venezuela is almost completely dependent on oil exports, which have fallen by a third since its peak and its refineries ran at just 31 percent of capacity in the first quarter. The Latin American country is in the grip of a deep recession with severe shortages of medicine and food as well as a growing exodus of its people. PDVSA and the Venezuelan foreign ministry did not respond on Sunday to requests for comment. Dutch authorities said they are assessing the situation on Bonaire. Conoco's claims against Venezuela and state-run PDVSA in international courts have totaled $33 billion, the largest by any company. ""Any potential impacts on communities are the result of PDVSA's illegal expropriation of our assets and its decision to ignore the judgment of the ICC tribunal,"" Conoco said in an email to Reuters. The U.S firm added it will work with the community and local authorities to address issues that may arise as a result of enforcement actions. PDVSA has significant assets in the Caribbean. On Bonaire, it owns the 10-million-barrel BOPEC terminal which handles logistics and fuel shipments to customers, particularly in Asia. In Aruba, PDVSA and its unit Citgo lease a refinery and a storage terminal. On the island of St. Eustatius, it rents storage tanks at the Statia terminal, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where over 4 million barrels of Venezuelan crude were retained by court order, according to one of the sources. NuStar is aware of the order and ""assessing our legal and commercial options,"" said spokesman Chris Cho. The company does not expect the matter to change its earnings outlook, he said. Conoco also sought to attach PDVSA inventories on Curacao, home of the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery and Bullenbay oil terminal. But the order could not immediately be enforced, according to two of the sources. Last year, PDVSA's shipments from Bonaire and St Eustatius terminals accounted for about 10 percent of its total exports, according to internal figures from the state-run company. The exports were mostly crude and fuel oil for Asian customers including ChinaOil, China's Zhenhua Oil and India's Reliance Industries. From its largest Caribbean operations in Curacao, PDVSA shipped 14 percent of its exports last year, including products exported by its Isla refinery to Caribbean islands and crude from its Bullenbay terminal to buyers of Venezuelan crude all over the world. PDVSA on Friday ordered its oil tankers sailing across the Caribbean to return to Venezuelan waters and await further instructions, according to a document viewed by Reuters. In the last year, several cargoes of Venezuelan crude have been retained or seized in recent years over unpaid freight fees and related debts. ""This is terrible (for PDVSA),"" said a source familiar with the court order of attachment. The state-run company ""cannot comply with all the committed volume for exports"" and the Conoco action imperils its ability to ship fuel oil to China or access inventories to be exported from Bonaire. At the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Conoco had sought up to $22 billion from PDVSA for broken contracts and loss of future profits from two oil producing joint ventures, which were nationalized in 2007 under late Venezuela President Hugo Chavez. The U.S. firm left the country after it could not reach a deal to convert its projects into joint ventures controlled by PDVSA. A separate arbitration case involving the loss of its Venezuelan assets is before a World Bank tribunal, the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. Exxon Mobil Corp also has brought two separate arbitration claims over the 2007 nationalization of its projects in Venezuela.

107,2018-05-06,Belly Would Rather Face Forward Than Navel Gaze,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/arts/music/belly-tanya-donelly-dove-reunion.html,951," Why go through the turmoil of re-forming a beloved but long-dormant band whose place in pop history is secure? In 2018, a better question is, why not? “We decided we were going to never return to it rather than go back and try to figure everything out,” Tanya Donelly said, referring to the implosion of her band Belly 23 years ago. Facing forward has been “such a healthy model, I’m starting to apply it to a lot of things in my life.” Ms. Donelly, 51, was phoning during a break in rehearsals with the band, who just released “Dove,” its third album — or its first since Season 6 of “Seinfeld,” to put it another way. The band is back playing in the bassist Gail Greenwood’s Rhode Island basement, known as the Rock ’n’ Roll Control Center, just as it did when Ms. Donelly parlayed her status as an indie-rock lifer into mainstream pop success with Belly’s 1993 debut “Star,” then flamed out shortly after its second album, “King,” two years later. “I think we have an extremely fortunate complementary set of skills,” she said. “We were aware of it and then we lost sight of it, which is a very 20-something thing to do.” What was once a life-consuming, deeply romantic — or at least deeply romanticized — struggle to get signed, get heard and get along is now, for many bands of a certain vintage, a more comfortable experience, free of the pressures that may have contributed to their demise decades ago. They, as Belly does now, have more control over how they tour and how they make and release new music. “It doesn’t have that feel of a biological imperative,” Ms. Donelly said. Of the ’90s-era indie bands who have had creatively resurgent second lives, many hail from Belly’s peer group in the Boston area, including Dinosaur Jr., Mission of Burma and the Breeders, which Ms. Donelly was once in. Her stepsister Kristin Hersh, with whom she played in Throwing Muses in the late ’80s and early ’90s, was at the forefront of crowdsourcing records directly from fans, a now-common practice Belly used to help finance “Dove.” “Kristin was a complete pioneer and just watching that develop was really inspiring,” Ms. Donelly said. “I like the porousness of it.” Anyone charmed by the mix of melodic hooks and imagistic lyrics exemplified by Belly’s breakout hit “Feed the Tree” will find a way into “Dove.” “Shiny One,” a single, is confident and propulsive, while “Stars Align” is unrelentingly sunny radio-friendly pop, whether or not radio friends it back. “This sounds insane, but we didn’t have one conversation about what we wanted this album to sound like, we just started writing,” Ms. Donelly said. With Ms. Greenwood and the drummer Chris Gorman living in Rhode Island, Ms. Donelly in Massachusetts, and the guitarist Tom Gorman in upstate New York, the songs were largely composed sending ideas over email. One of the new album’s standouts, the slow-burn “Human Child,” addresses the bubble of fame that burst quickly as directly as Ms. Donelly’s lyrics allow. “To be honest, that is a letter to myself,” she said. “How to weave what happened before into your present in a way that is constructive — it’s easy to hang on to garbage.” Since Belly’s breakup, Ms. Greenwood has played with L7 and Bif Naked, while Tom and Chris Gorman work in commercial photography. Ms. Donelly released four solo albums and raised two daughters with her husband of 22 years. She also became a postpartum doula, and while she stops short of crediting that work with the band’s revival, it did make reconciliation of the estranged band members feel like a natural byproduct of maturing. “I don’t think I consciously was doing it for any self-improvement reasons; that was just kind of a happy accident,” she said. A friendly, inside-joke-laden icebreaker email chain begat the successful dusting off of some old songs in the Control Center, then a couple of new songs that felt right, then a handful of shows in 2016 before committing to a new album. Helping to keep priorities in check was Ms. Greenwood’s discovery, just six weeks before their first reunion dates, that she had cancer. Rather than add urgency or upend plans, this just reinforced the notion that Belly wasn’t worth reviving unless it remained a respite from real-life troubles rather than a source of them. “I don’t mean to say we wouldn’t have been like this if it had happened in the ’90s, but back then everything was so serious,” said Ms. Greenwood, who described herself as a “walking petri dish of fast-dividing cells.” “And now it’s like, ‘I’ll tell you what’s serious.’” Ms. Donelly has drawn recent inspiration from artists who followed in her footsteps such as Phoebe Bridgers and the British sister act Colour Me Wednesday, but she is wary that her role among the wave of successful female-fronted bands in the ’90s is sometimes misunderstood. “There’s this assumption that every single female artist from the time was hanging out and that it felt like a movement,” she said. “That always stops me in my tracks. Even my daughter has asked me.” The world that greets Belly now offers new challenges, including a rapper named Belly (“There’s misunderstandings on a weekly basis,” Ms. Donelly said). But this time it’s just the four of them in a van — no roadies, no trucks, no buses, no drama. And they won’t need the drama for creative inspiration as they keep writing new songs; Tom Gorman has already been emailing new snippets. “I feel like life is endlessly complicated,” Ms. Donelly said. “And human interaction is an endless mine of material.”"
108,2018-05-06,Scholars Have Data on Millions of Facebook Users. Who’s Guarding It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/technology/facebook-information-data-sets-academics.html,1562," SAN FRANCISCO — In July 2014, a team of four Swedish and Polish researchers began using an automated program to better understand what people posted on Facebook. The program, known as a “scraper,” let the researchers log every comment and interaction from 160 public Facebook pages for nearly two years. By May 2016, they had amassed enough information to track how 368 million Facebook members behaved on the social network. It is one of the largest known sets of user data ever assembled from Facebook. “We’re concerned about how easy it was to collect this,” said Fredrik Erlandsson, one of the researchers and a lecturer at the Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden. Last December, he and his colleagues published a research paper in the journal Entropy detailing how their methods of trawling social media sites could be replicated. For more than a decade, professors, doctoral candidates and researchers from academic institutions around the world have harvested information from Facebook using techniques similar to those of Dr. Erlandsson and his team. They have compiled hundreds of Facebook data sets that captured the behavior of a few thousand to hundreds of millions of individuals, according to interviews with more than a dozen scholars. Their practices came to light in March when The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Aleksandr Kogan, a University of Cambridge psychology professor, had obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users through a quiz app. Mr. Kogan sold the information to Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm with ties to the Trump campaign, so it could build psychographic profiles of American voters. Last week, Cambridge Analytica said it would cease operations after the uproar over its use of personal information. But while what happened with Mr. Kogan’s Facebook data set is now known, the fate of other information hoards is murkier. In many cases, the data was used for research or scholarly articles. The information was then sometimes left unsecured and stored on open servers that offered access to anyone. Some academics said the data could have been easily copied and sold to marketers or political consulting firms. The potential result is more leakage of Facebook users’ information through academic circles, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication at the University of Oxford who has studied data collection from Facebook. “The academic world is highly decentralized, and each individual, each institution, has a different way of securing their data,” Dr. Nielsen said. “Even if almost everyone in the academic community is careful and protects the data, you still can end up in a situation where someone is careless or acts in bad faith and sells access. It’s hard to imagine how Facebook stops that from happening.” The Times reviewed half a dozen Facebook data sets compiled by academics from 2006 to 2017. One, gathered from 2015 to 2017 by researchers in Denmark and New Zealand, examined 1.3 million people in Denmark — about a quarter of the country’s population — to determine how liking one political page on Facebook could predict how someone would vote in the future. Another set, from 2013, by a group of Norwegian academics focused on the civic engagement of 21 million Facebook members on four continents. The Danish research team did not respond to a request for comment. Petter Bae Brandtzaeg, one of the Norwegian researchers, said he understood concerns about data gathering. “As a researcher you get immediate access to people’s behavior, attitudes, feelings and relationships, which are of course tempting for all,” he wrote in an email. He said many researchers lacked the technical expertise to properly secure data. The Facebook data was typically amassed through scraper programs that crawled the social network to document what was posted, or through quiz apps that requested access to people’s profiles. The results included users’ locations, interests, political affiliations, Facebook interactions and even music preferences. In most cases, researchers assigned numbers to people whose Facebook information they had obtained to maintain anonymity. But the more data there is, the easier it is to overlay one information set with another to identify someone. One 2015 paper published in the journal Science looked at credit card spending data and found that data scientists could pinpoint 90 percent of the shoppers by name with just four random pieces of information from sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Once people are identified and their interests and interactions known, they can be targeted with advertising and mobilized for political campaigns or other causes. For years, Facebook had no specific policies about academics’ access to user data, though it had guidelines on working with third parties. While the company has a rule that forbids the use of scrapers, it has not enforced that policy against scholars. And at times, it has assisted researchers with studies. In 2014, though, Facebook began limiting third-party apps, like quizzes, from obtaining users’ information. Since Mr. Kogan’s actions were revealed, fueling an outcry over data privacy, Facebook has made further changes. The company has given people more control over their privacy settings. It has said it will audit  all apps that collected large amounts of Facebook data, and it temporarily stopped allowing new apps to gather information from its members. Last month, Facebook also narrowed the number of academics it would work with, saying it would collaborate with those who wanted to research the impact of social media on elections through an “independent election research commission.” Only scholars with election-related projects can apply. “We are taking a hard look at the information apps can use when you connect them to Facebook, as well as other data practices,” Susan Glick, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. “These other data practices include academic research.” Before social media existed, researchers hoping to study human behavior had to painstakingly seek out groups of people to examine. Social media has let them easily find masses of subjects — as well as information like their date of birth, gender and interests — and observe some of their online behavior in real time. “It was unprecedented,” said Christian Rudder, a founder of OkCupid, a dating and social media site, who published the book “Dataclysm” in 2014 on how much people revealed through their online lives. One of the academic community’s earliest known Facebook data sets was collected in 2006 by Harvard University professors. It covered 1,700 people who agreed to have their Facebook information anonymously analyzed. The data was later easily traced back by other academics to Harvard freshmen. In Britain, researchers were doing similar work through different means. In 2007, Michal Kosinski, then deputy director at the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge, worked with a colleague, David Stillwell, to create My Personality, a quiz app that offered to assess people’s personalities in exchange for data about them. It was one of the first times a quiz app had been used for obtaining Facebook members’ information. My Personality has now collected details on more than six million Facebook users, according to the academics who have gathered the data. Many researchers have since copied the quiz app method, including Mr. Kogan. In interviews with The Times, Dr. Kosinski and Dr. Stillwell said they took great care to keep the data they procured anonymous. Dr. Stillwell added that the information had been widely shared with other researchers, but any academic who wished to use it was vetted. Dr. Kosinski acknowledged that data is not a physical item that is easy to control. Once a data set is created, it can be copied and shared until its original source is unknown. He said collection of information from Facebook had become widespread over the years, not only by academics but also by developers, marketers, data analytics companies and others. “What Kogan did was wrong. But what Kogan did, many others do on a much larger scale,” Dr. Kosinski said. “They just don’t get caught.” In 2014, after Facebook announced it would restrict third-party apps from gaining access to user data, the reach of quiz apps became limited. But scrapers continued to improve and more speedily compile information from the social network. A group of German academics used a scraper to harvest the profiles of 60,000 Facebook users in the New Orleans area starting in late 2008. The researchers, whose goal was to study how people’s friendships change online over time, recorded over 800,000 interactions during a two-year period. They did not respond to a request for comment. Some scholars said Facebook’s recent privacy changes may have gone too far by also cutting off academics who behaved responsibly. “Academics would argue that we need access to primary data,” said Dr. Nielsen of Oxford. He said the changes might lead to an asymmetry, with internal Facebook researchers accumulating mounds of data while outside academics would not. “If that happens, only Facebook will really know very much about how Facebook actually operates and how people act on Facebook,” he said. Dr. Erlandsson said the paper he and his colleagues published last December initially made little splash. But since the Cambridge Analytica revelations, he has seen renewed interest. He said he had been contacted by companies — he declined to name them — interested in buying the data on 368 million Facebook members. “I’m not interested in selling,” he said. “And the truth is, anyone could easily do this themselves.”"
