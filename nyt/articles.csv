0,2018-04-28,Here Are the Biggest Stories in American Politics This Week ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/us/politics/politics-news-round-up.html,1557," By Emily Cochrane Whether it was President Trump’s first state dinner, the visits of two prominent European leaders, the withdrawal of the president’s nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs or a summit meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea, it was a big week in American politics and diplomacy. Here’s a look back at what you might have missed. Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, the White House physician, withdrew his nomination to be secretary of veterans affairs on Thursday after lawmakers publicized a litany of allegations about him. The accusations included accounts of his liberally giving out prescription medication, being intoxicated at work and presiding over a hostile work environment.  President Trump and other top administration officials strongly defended Dr. Jackson, citing favorable performance reviews from previous administrations. But interviews with current and former colleagues showed that the isolation of the White House medical unit hid the perception of Dr. Jackson as a bully who loosely dispensed strong drugs, kept sloppy records and drank too much.

News Analysis: For Many, Life in Trump’s Orbit Ends in a Crash Landing President Emmanuel Macron of France came to the United States with the intention of persuading Mr. Trump to not scrap the Iran nuclear deal next month, but it remained unclear whether he made progress toward that goal. And while Mr. Macron criticized Mr. Trump’s policies in a rare joint address before Congress, the bromance between the two flourished during the visit. Mr. Macron and his wife, Brigitte, were treated to the administration’s first state dinner, a 21-gun salute and a private evening at George Washington’s home.  Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany received a less extravagant greeting when she arrived on Friday. She reiterated Mr. Macron’s push for the United States to remain part of the nuclear deal and pressed for a stronger commitment that the European Union would be exempt from the coming steel and aluminum tariffs.  It’s likely that when Mr. Trump visits Britain in July — an on-again, off-again trip announced Thursday — he will receive a similarly subdued reception.

Here’s What He Can Expect. For the first time, the Supreme Court heard arguments over Mr. Trump’s efforts to impose a ban on travel to the United States from several predominately Muslim countries. Although a decision was not made, the court’s five-member conservative majority seemed ready to approve a revised version of the president’s plan.  Justices also heard arguments in their third voting-rights case of the term, weighing a long-running dispute over congressional and state legislative districts in Texas. Challengers say the districts discriminate against minority voters. The court upheld the constitutionality of a procedure that eases challenges to questionable patents. In a separate case, it ruled that foreign corporations — in this case, a bank based in Jordan with a branch in New York — may not be sued for complicity in human rights abuses abroad.

Mueller III, who is leading the Russia investigation. And while Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said he will not allow the bill to reach the floor for a vote, the bipartisan support in the committee sends a warning message to Mr. Trump about the consequences of firing Mr. Mueller. It was also revealed Friday that the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower in June 2016 has recanted her earlier denials of Russian government ties and admitted that she was a source of information for a top Kremlin official. The revelation came hours before Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee announced they had found no evidence that the Trump campaign aided Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the latest high-profile addition to the president’s legal team, is said to be working to reopen negotiations on a possible interview between the president and the special counsel. Mr. Trump continued to distance himself from Michael D. Cohen, his personal lawyer who is under investigation from the Justice Department. Attorney General Jeff Sessions also declined to say whether he had recused himself from the inquiry into Mr. Cohen, given his recusal from the special counsel’s investigation. He also declined to answer when asked if he would quit if Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, was fired.

The confirmation followed a late approval from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which almost failed to give him a favorable vote.  On his first full day as secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo traveled to Europe and warned that Mr. Trump may withdraw from the Iran deal early next month. He also called for European countries to increase their military spending.  Mr. Trump announced Tuesday that he would dispatch Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and other economic advisers to China next week. With the two countries locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle, Mr. Mnuchin and the rest of the American delegation will be charged with forestalling an all-out trade war.  In an unusual Twitter exchange that bypassed the usual topics of media and politics, Mr. Trump reached out to Kanye West, the bombastic rapper and longtime supporter. The president publicly thanked Mr. West after the rapper praised him on Twitter, asserting that the two were brothers who shared “dragon energy.” Additional Reading Jeff Sessions Is Serving, and Doing His Best to Ignore, Trump The Biggest Nafta Hurdle Now May Be Congress In a series of hearings and briefings this week, lawmakers interviewed Mr. Sessions, questioned the salary of the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and grilled Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The most contentious hearing was with Mr. Pruitt, who faced an entire day of questions about his spending, housing arrangements and raises for staff members. But he dodged the blame, pointing a finger instead on decisions made by his employees.  The news that Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, had asked for the resignation of the House chaplain two weeks ago set off further division in Congress. The Rev. Patrick J. Conroy said he believed a prayer he gave while the House was debating tax overhaul legislation is what elicited Mr. Ryan’s ire.

The leaders agreed to work to remove all nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula and pursue talks with the United States to formally end the Korean War.  It was the first time a North Korean leader had ever stepped foot in the South, something Mr. Trump applauded on Friday. It paves the way for a summit meeting between the American and North Korean leaders. But Mr. Trump vowed that he would not be fooled by the North the way he said his predecessors had.  The Trump administration also abruptly redirected Washington’s pick to be ambassador to Australia, and instead named him the American envoy to Seoul. It fills a diplomatic void right before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim are scheduled to meet.

1,2018-04-28,Saudi Media: Airstrike Kills Houthi Leaders in Yemen Capital,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/28/world/middleeast/ap-ml-yemen.html,506," By The Associated Press SANAA, Yemen — A Saudi-led airstrike targeting a high-level meeting of Shiite rebels in Yemen's capital killed two of the group's leaders and dozens of their militiamen, the kingdom's state media reported early Saturday. The Shiite rebels known as Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the strike. Saudi state-run television offered the report, saying the strike Friday killed more than 50 militiamen, including the two leaders. It did not elaborate. That dispatch followed a far more detailed report on the strike by Al-Arabiya, a Dubai-based satellite news network now believed to be majority-owned by Saudi Arabia. Al-Arabiya, without offering a source, said the strike hit a building belonging to Yemen's Interior Ministry in the country's rebel-held capital, Sanaa. It said more than 38 Houthi fighters including the two leaders were killed in the strike targeting a high-level meeting. Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, acknowledged that Houthi leaders met Friday to discuss Saturday's funeral of Saleh al-Samad, a Houthi political leader killed over a week ago in a Saudi airstrike on the coastal city of Hodeida. However, the only airstrike Friday night in Sanaa the outlet reported on involved wounded civilians. Later, Al-Masirah reported that Houthi forces fired eight ballistic missiles at ""economic and vital"" targets in Saudi Arabia's southern city of Jizan and hit the targets with ""high accuracy."" The Saudi-led coalition said in statement, carried by state news agency SPA, that the kingdom's air defense forces intercepted four of the missiles fired toward Jizan. The Directorate of Saudi Civil Defense said it received reports that shrapnel killed one civilian and damaged two houses and three vehicles. Houthis held al-Samad's funeral in the capital, bringing together thousands of Yemenis in Sabeen square to pay tribute to the slain head of the rebels' Supreme Political Council, which runs rebel-held areas in Yemen. Top Houthi officials including al-Samad's successor Mahdi al-Mashat, a former Houthi fighter, attended. Houthi leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi vowed to avenge al-Samad's death. The Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, have previously fired missiles targeting the Saudi mainland, including the capital, Riyadh. They see themselves as retaliating against heavy Saudi-led airstrikes in parts of Yemen. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia said the rebels had fired at least 116 missiles at the kingdom since it went to war in Yemen in 2015. Yemen's three-year stalemated war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced 3 million and helped spawn a devastating cholera epidemic in the Arab world's poorest country. It began after the Houthis swept through Sanaa and farther south, sparking a Saudi-led military intervention on behalf of the country's internationally recognized government. The kingdom's devastating air campaign repeatedly has struck markets, medical facilities and civilian targets, drawing international criticism. The coalition's blockade on ports under Houthi control has been a main factor pushing the country into near starvation, according to United Nations agencies and rights groups. Meanwhile, the Iranian-backed Houthis face criticism for laying mines that have killed and maimed civilians, while allegedly diverting humanitarian aid to their own cadres and conducting mass roundups of their perceived enemies.

2,2018-04-28,"Sainsbury's, Walmart's Asda to Create UK Supermarket Powerhouse",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/28/business/28reuters-sainsbury-s-walmart-m-a.html,757," By Reuters LONDON — Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda are in talks to create Britain's biggest supermarket group, a combination which would surpass Tesco's grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds. Sainsbury's confirmed on Saturday that it and Walmart, the world's largest retailer, were in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury's and Asda businesses, the UK's No. 2 and 3 UK grocers. It said they will make a further announcement at 0600 GMT on Monday. Britain's big grocers, including No. 4 player Morrisons, have been losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and must also deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the march of Amazon. Sainsbury's gave no details of the deal's structure but a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters the holding company of the combined group would retain the Sainsbury's name. Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who used to work for Asda, would lead it, the source said. The source described the planned deal -- which would consolidate a brutally competitive UK food market while helping Walmart address its underperforming UK arm through greater buying power -- as a ""merger"". Three sources with knowledge of the situation said Walmart would take a minority stake in the combined business. Two said Walmart would be the biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 40 percent. The Qatar Investment Authority, which has tried to buy Sainsbury’s in the past, is currently the supermarket group’s biggest shareholder with a 22 percent stake. The deal would probably dilute that holding. Sainsbury's invited media and analysts to presentations scheduled for Monday, indicating a done deal. Walmart declined to comment. Asda did not respond to requests for comment. Sky News, which first reported the news, said the deal could be worth over 10 billion pounds. One of the sources who spoke to Reuters said the combined company would have an enterprise value, including debt, of around 15 billion pounds and would remain listed in London. Sainsbury's shares closed on Friday at 269 pence, giving the company an equity value of 6 billion pounds. The deal would be the largest in the UK supermarket sector since Morrisons acquired the Safeway business in 2004. PROFIT DECLINE Sainsbury's has reported three straight years of profit decline, and is forecast to report a fourth on Wednesday. Asda has seen two years of falls. Asda, which Walmart bought in 1999 for 6.7 billion pounds, is one of the retail giant's largest and worst-performing international businesses. Analysts reckon Asda was hurt the most by the rise of the discounters, which eroded its traditional price advantage. ""Asda doesn't have discount and it doesn't have convenience. This (deal) provides a potential solution for Walmart to deliver a more profitable Asda in the long run,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. In recent years Walmart has shifted its traditional approach from building overseas businesses itself to partnering with local players, for example in China. In January, Walmart appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit with a remit that included fixing its UK operations. McKenna is a Briton and a veteran of Asda, where she served as both COO and finance chief. Roger Burnley, who took over as Asda CEO in January, is a former Sainsbury's executive, working under Coupe. One of the sources said he would stay at the combined group. Tesco last month moved to strengthen its grip on the UK food sector, completing the 4 billion-pound purchase of wholesaler Booker. In 2016 Sainsbury's purchased general merchandise retailer Argos for 1.1 billion pounds. Sainsbury's and the similarly-sized Asda would overtake Tesco with a combined market share of 31.4 percent versus Tesco's 27.6 percent, according to the latest data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel. Asda stores would continue to trade under their own brand, separate from the more upmarket Sainsbury's, the sources said. REGULATORY HURDLES A major uncertainty surrounding any combination would be whether the move secures approval from Britain's competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), given that the deal would effectively create a duopoly. However, the CMA's surprise unconditional waving through of Tesco's Booker deal may have changed the regulatory landscape.  ""It's going to be a really big test of the CMA's understanding of the market and whether it believes that this deal is in the consumer's interest,"" said Shore Capital's Black. ""It's hard to believe it would not require considerable store disposals and there aren't many buyers out there.""

3,2018-04-28,Greece Approves F-16 Fighter Jet Upgrade Deal With the United States,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/28/business/28reuters-greece-us-jets.html,312," By Reuters ATHENS — Greece on Saturday approved a deal with the United States to upgrade dozens of its F-16 fighter jets at a cost of roughly 1.2 billion euros (1.06 billion pounds), a measure the bailed-out country said would not harm its future fiscal progress. The potential deal to overhaul the aircraft came to light during a visit by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October.  Greece's top decision-making body on foreign affairs and defence matters, KYSEA, which Tsipras heads, unanimously sealed the agreement for the upgrade on Saturday, the premier's press office said in a statement. Three of the 85 jets earmarked for modernisation will be upgraded in the United States while the rest will be refurbished in Greece, a Greek defence ministry source said, adding that the cost would be about 1.2 billion euros. The government said last year the overhaul would be paid in annual instalments of about 110 million euros over a decade. Athens said on Saturday that Washington had accepted a revised Greek proposal that takes into consideration the country's fiscal obligations in the coming years. It did not give details on the revised proposal. Greece, which will exit its third international bailout in August but will still have to attain primary budget surpluses in the medium term, has said the deal should not worry its EU lenders. Defence spending has been reduced during Greece's seven-year debt crisis, which shrank the size of its economy by more than a quarter and drove its jobless rate to nearly 28 percent. However, the country still spends about 2 percent of its gross domestic product -- roughly 3.5 billion euros -- on defence, more than the EU's average. That is largely due to long-standing tensions with its neighbour and fellow NATO member Turkey, which have risen in recent months.

4,2018-04-28,"Zimbabwe Legalizes Marijuana for Medicinal, Scientific Uses",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/28/world/africa/ap-af-zimbabwe-marijuana.html,189," By The Associated Press HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe has legalized the production of marijuana for medicinal and scientific purposes, making it the rare African country to turn the drug into a source of revenue. A government notice issued by the health minister says individuals and corporations can apply for licenses to grow marijuana, whose production and possession had brought up to 12 years in prison. Recreational use remains illegal. The decision is a marked shift from the traditionally tough stance on marijuana in the largely conservative country where members of Parliament who had advocated for legalization often were openly mocked. The tiny nation of Lesotho last year became the first in Africa to issue a license for medical marijuana. Countries including Malawi and Ghana are reportedly exploring ways to legalize the drug. A South African court last year ruled that private use of marijuana was legal but the government appealed the ruling at the Constitutional Court. Much of Africa still criminalizes the production and use of marijuana. Africa is second only to the Americas in terms of production and consumption of the drug, according to the United Nations' 2017 World Drug Report. ___    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
5,2018-04-28,Pakistan Moves Jailed Doctor Who Helped Track Bin Laden,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/28/world/asia/28reuters-pakistan-usa-doctor.html,498," By Reuters PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Pakistani prison authorities have moved the jailed doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down Osama bin Laden, his attorney said on Saturday, speculating it could be a prelude to his release. The continued imprisonment of Dr. Shakil Afridi has long been a source of tension between Pakistan and the United States, which cut military aid over accusations Pakistan continues to shelter Taliban militants fighting U.S. and Afghan soldiers across the border in Afghanistan. A jail official in the northwestern city of Peshawar told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Afridi had been transferred to Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, but said the reasons were unclear and could simply be security-related. Afridi’s lawyer, Qamar Nadeem, confirmed the transfer of his client but said he was not sure where he was now. Judicial officials could not be reached on Saturday, nor could embassy officials for the United States, which has for years called on Pakistan to release Afridi. Afridi was accused of treason after word spread he had helped the CIA collect genetic samples of the bin Laden family, paving the way for a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in 2011 in the town of Abbottabad that killed the al Qaeda leader accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States that killed nearly 3,000 people. He was arrested days after the U.S. operation - which Pakistan called a violation of its sovereignty - and charged with aiding terrorists. Afridi was sentenced to 23 years' jail for financing terrorism. That conviction was overturned in 2013, but he is still serving time for other terrorism-related convictions, his lawyer said.  He also faced a murder trial related to the death of a patient more than a decade ago. However, the layer said Afridi had recently had his latest sentence reduced to seven years in a clemency action, and had served about that amount of time already. ""So I think he can be released very soon,"" Nadeem told Reuters.  There were no other immediate indications of any release in the works, however. A U.S. State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, called on the Pakistani government to ensure Afridi's safety. ""We are aware ‎of reports that Dr. Afridi has been transferred to another prison, and call on the Government of Pakistan to take all necessary measures to ensure Dr. Afridi's safety,"" the official said. ""We don't have anything else at this time and would refer you to the government of Pakistan as to the reasons for his transfer,"" the official added. In January 2017, Pakistan's then-law minister said the country would not release Afridi under any U.S. pressure. “Afridi worked against the law and our national interest, and the Pakistan government has repeatedly been telling the United States that under our law he committed a crime and was facing the law,” Zahid Hamid was quoted as saying at the time.

6,2018-04-28,Russia Close to Drawing Up Draft Law to Raise Pension Age: PM Medvedev,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/28/world/europe/28reuters-russia-pensions-medvedev.html,396," By Reuters MOSCOW — Russia is close to drawing up a draft law to raise the pension age, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Saturday, but wants to do so carefully and in a way that avoids disrupting the existing pension system or causing social tensions.  Policymakers see raising the pension age -- currently 55 for women and 60 for men -- as a way of spurring faster growth at a time when Western sanctions are a drag on the economy. ""A pretty serious study of all these questions has already been done,"" Medvedev told state TV channel Rossiya 1. ""... We are on the brink of starting to discuss this at a legislative level. ... it (a decision) will be taken based on different factors, it will be done carefully, and in such a way that will not unbalance the pension system or, on the other hand, create negative feelings among people.""  Former finance minister Alexei Kudrin, now an unofficial adviser to President Vladimir Putin, has said Russia faces a big increase in the number of pensioners in coming years which will coincide with a shrinking workforce.  Any increase in the pension age would allow the government to cut contributions from the state budget, which could help fund pre-election promises of higher social and infrastructure spending by Putin, who starts a new term in office on May 7. Two government sources and one source familiar with the situation told Reuters that Putin had already agreed the pension age needed to go up. ""In February, there was a meeting of government officials with the president and everyone agreed to increase the pension age. The president said not to do it before the elections,"" one of the sources said. The government is now discussing how to do it and two proposals have emerged as the most realistic, two sources said. The first, from the finance ministry, would see the pension age increased every year by one year until it reaches 65 years for both men and women. The second, from economic adviser Kudrin, envisages increasing the retirement age for women by six months every year until it reaches 63 years, and by four months each year for men until it reaches 65 years.  A final decision is expected to be made by a new government that Putin will name after his inauguration.  (Editing by Andrew Osborn and Catherine Evans)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
7,2018-04-28,Stories of Resilience Inspired Readers to Support Neediest Cases Fund,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/nyregion/stories-of-resilience-inspired-readers-to-support-neediest-cases-fund.html,1301," The Neediest Cases Fund By Emily Palmer and John Otis Last fall, Atreyal Ransom could only dream of taking a souped-up Subaru for a spin. Mr. Ransom, of Brooklyn, hoped to one day repair cars and cellphones as a career and maybe open a business, but first he needed help paying for college books. Now he gets behind the wheel and under the hood for a living. In the Bronx, Clementine Matthias, a single mother, had lost her biggest source of strength and support when her mother died in 2016. But in recent months, she has benefited from the kindness of a stranger. A decade had passed since G’Mario Charleston, an aspiring actor from Mississippi, stepped onstage. That changed this past winter, and he is now studying acting in Manhattan. Mr. Ransom, Ms. Matthias and Mr. Charleston all received money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and since their stories were featured in The Times’s annual campaign, they have more to tell. The Neediest Cases Fund thrives on the generosity of readers. And during the fund’s 106th campaign, they responded even after a number of natural disasters, including devastating hurricanes, prompted fund-raising efforts and calls for help across the country. Times readers remained committed to a maxim that has endured for decades: “Remember the Neediest.” The fund primarily helps struggling New Yorkers, a small number of whose stories were detailed during the latest campaign, which ran from Oct. 15, 2017, to January and raised $5,838,425.31. The previous campaign reached $6,177,625. Dozens of profiles highlighted the ways that even a modest donation can drastically improve a life. The money raised benefits eight organizations: Brooklyn Community Services, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, Children’s Aid, the Community Service Society of New York, the International Rescue Committee, UJA-Federation of New York and FPWA, formerly the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. The organizations spend the money at their discretion, often to cover gaps in public assistance. The Times Company pays all the administrative costs for the fund. It invests unrestricted contributions of $100,000 or more from trusts and estates in an endowment. The income flows into the next year’s campaign. Many readers donated to the campaign, while others gave directly to those profiled. Some reached out to help people along their desired career paths. Mr. Ransom, 20, who as a boy lost his mother to cancer, developed an interest in cars, especially Subarus, from his father. When the chief executive of Subaru of America, Thomas J. Doll, came across Mr. Ransom’s story, he helped facilitate a job offer at Island Toyota Service Center on Staten Island, which also services Subarus, Mazdas and other brands. For the past few months, Mr. Ransom has worked there 16 hours a week as a technician, handling oil changes and tire rotations. Next month, after Mr. Ransom graduates from Borough of Manhattan Community College, he hopes to begin working there full-time. “You can see he’s enjoying what he’s doing,” said Sal Sciarrino, a service manager who supervises Mr. Ransom. “He’s very responsible, always on time. He’s a pleasure to work with.” Part of Mr. Ransom’s job is driving the cars onto a lift. “It’s like five seconds in each car,” he said. Last month, he changed the oil of one of his dream sports cars: Subaru’s WRX STI. Under the hood, the engine had red trim. Inside, the seats were black with red stitching. “I was in it a little longer,” he said. Like Mr. Ransom, Wendy Genao, who once struggled to find her academic footing, also attends Borough of Manhattan Community College. Early into her college career, she was on academic probation while facing lengthy commutes and challenges at home. Disappointed by her performance, she recommitted to her studies, and money from the Neediest Cases fund was used to buy her a laptop for college. Over the past two semesters, she has raised her grade-point average and declared a major in psychology. Much of her newfound maturity is thanks to Pinky, a rabbit she recently welcomed into the Staten Island home she shares with her mother. Pinky has bridged the divide between mother and daughter, encouraging frequent visits into Ms. Genao’s room. “I don’t usually like people in my space,” she said. “But my mom loves petting the rabbit.” And the visits have opened lines of communication. Ms. Genao has set her sights on earning a bachelor’s degree. Other fund recipients are also anticipating brighter futures. An extended convalescence after heart surgery in 2005 led Charlotte Wood, 67, to lose her apartment and take up residence in a rehabilitation center. For nearly 10 years, her health deteriorated and her spirit atrophied. In 2014, she moved into an apartment in Far Rockaway, Queens, where the ocean air was a salve for her respiratory illness. Living by the water, she said, restored her vigor for life. After an article on Ms. Wood appeared in The Times in October, she obtained a one-bedroom apartment in Mount Vernon, N.Y., through a housing lottery. One reader, moved by Ms. Wood’s story, donated $500, which Ms. Wood used to furnish her new home with a dining room table, a recliner and a television. Her relatives in Manhattan and the Bronx used to visit her only sporadically because of the long travel time. Now, “it’s 15 minutes away by Uber and 30 minutes away by public transportation,” Ms. Wood said of her new home. “That makes a difference.” Her next steps are improving her health and regaining lost mobility. She misses living by the water dreadfully, she said, and has been charting out public transportation routes to the sea. “I’m going to sniff out the beach,” Ms. Wood said. “Like a hound dog.” Ms. Matthias, a single mother of two, has also received an outpouring of support since sharing her struggles. Alan Shapiro, a partner at the law firm Phillips Nizer, took notice. Since 2006, his firm has sponsored an annual fund-raising lunch for someone profiled as part of the Neediest Cases campaign. This year, the lunch raised roughly $3,000 for Ms. Matthias, who was once homeless and served jail time and has a son, Franklin, with special needs. Mr. Shapiro, 78, said he had committed to further assisting Ms. Matthias, and would pay for Franklin’s 15th birthday party in June, which he would also attend. Ms. Matthias plans to throw an outdoor party with hired entertainment. “Each year is a milestone,” she said, noting that Franklin’s odds of survival at birth were low. “But 15 years is big. And I’m glad I’m able to do something extra big.” Another reader was touched by the story of Mr. Charleston, 34, who had become homeless as he tried to start his acting career. The reader, Dori Sullivan, the administrations coordinator at the Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute in Manhattan, shared the article with Victoria Krane, the school’s president. Ms. Krane’s reaction was: “Find him for me.” Mr. Charleston applied to the institute and was admitted to a one-year program on full scholarship. He was soon asked to audition for a role in the musical “Parade.” Mr. Charleston was cast in the ensemble and would lead a song. Over the past 10 years, Mr. Charleston had struggled with bills. He moved to Upper Manhattan in 2016 in hopes of returning to acting, but ended up living on the roof of his building. He now resides in an apartment in Brooklyn. Training at the institute, Ms. Krane said, is part of an effort to help Mr. Charleston put his past behind him. “I think he’s started to crack through that shell,” she said. After six weeks of intense rehearsals, he was onstage in February. “I went out there, the energy was so high,” he said, “I was just tingling.” Mr. Charleston traveled to Pittsburgh this weekend for an audition.

The policemen were also convicted of detaining another police officer they claimed had mistreated a colleague in their home province of Sharqiya, in the Nile Delta.  The prosecution accused the defendants of failing to perform their duties, a judicial source said. They were also charged with spreading false news and incitement against the ministry of the interior, the source said. Separately the Cairo court of Cassation, the country's highest civil court, confirmed death sentences passed on six people, and life sentences on 59 others, accused of storming and setting fire to a police station in the southern province of Minya in 2013, judicial sources said. The police station was attacked after the ousting from the presidency of Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Authorities accused all 65 defendants of belonging to or sympathizing with the group.

9,2018-04-28,Trump’s Role in Midterm Elections Roils Republicans,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/us/politics/trump-midterm-elections.html,1863," By Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump is privately rejecting the growing consensus among Republican leaders that they may lose the House and possibly the Senate in November, leaving party officials and the president’s advisers nervous that he does not grasp the gravity of the threat they face in the midterm elections. Congressional and party leaders and even some Trump aides are concerned that the president’s boundless self-assurance about politics will cause him to ignore or undermine their midterm strategy. In battleground states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada, Mr. Trump’s proclivity to be a loose cannon could endanger the Republican incumbents and challengers who are already facing ferocious Democratic headwinds. Republicans in Washington and Trump aides have largely given up assuming the president will ever stick to a teleprompter, but they have joined together to impress upon him just how bruising this November could be for Republicans — and how high the stakes are for Mr. Trump personally, given that a Democratic-controlled Congress could pursue aggressive investigations and even impeachment. Over dinner with the president and other Republican congressional leaders this month, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, phrased his advice for the president in the form of a reminder: Mr. Trump should never forget his central role in the 2018 campaign, Mr. McConnell said, explaining that Republicans’ prospects are linked to what he says and does and underscoring that their one-seat advantage in the Senate was in jeopardy. If Mr. McConnell’s warning was not clear enough, Marc Short, the White House’s legislative liaison, used the dinner to offer an even starker assessment. The G.O.P.’s House majority is all but doomed, he said. But Mr. Trump was not moved. “That’s not going to happen,” he said at different points during the evening, shrugging off the grim prognoses, according to multiple officials briefed on the conversation. The disconnect between the president — a political novice whose confidence in his instincts was grandly rewarded in 2016 — and more traditional party leaders demonstrates the depth of the Republicans’ challenges in what is likely to be a punishing campaign year. Mr. Trump is as impulsive as ever, fixated on personal loyalty, cultivating a winner’s image and privately prodding Republican candidates to demonstrate their affection for him — while complaining bitterly when he campaigns for those who lose. His preoccupation with the ongoing Russia investigation adds to the unpredictability, spurring Mr. Trump to fume aloud in ways that divide the G.O.P. and raising the prospect of legal confrontations amid the campaign. And despite projecting confidence, he polls nearly all those who enter the Oval Office about how they view the climate of the midterms. According to advisers, the president plans to hold a fund-raiser a week in the months to come and hopes to schedule regular rallies with candidates starting this summer. But there is not yet any coordinated effort about where to deploy Mr. Trump, and there are divisions within his ever-fractious circle of advisers about how to approach the elections. Among his close associates, a debate is raging about whether to focus on House races that could earn the president chits with Republican lawmakers who might ultimately vote on impeachment, or to dig in to defend the party’s tenuous Senate majority. “We need to be unified, and I know this is a frustrating business that we’re involved in, but rather than having circular firing squads, we need to be shooting outward,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said of the White House. Nearly every modern president has lost seats in his first midterm election, and Bill Clinton saw both the House and the Senate fall to Republicans in 1994. But given Mr. Trump’s polarizing administration, the results this fall are likely to hinge more than ever on the man in the White House. Anger toward Mr. Trump has become a crucial motivating tool for Democrats. Already, Republicans have spent millions on House special elections in strongly conservative areas of Pennsylvania and Arizona, losing one seat and retaining the other by a relatively narrow margin. At the same time, Republican leaders believe he is an essential force for savaging Senate Democrats and turning out voters on the right. Yet congressional leaders remain deeply frustrated about Mr. Trump’s improvisational pronouncements. At the White House dinner, Mr. McConnell raised one such policy and expressed hope that Mr. Trump could resolve the matter of his proposed tariffs, which have instilled deep worry among farm-state Republicans. “If we can get trade resolved that would be exceptionally important,” Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said when asked in an interview how the president could help in the midterms. Other Republican lawmakers have begun pleading with the president to be disciplined and hold up the growing economy and sweeping tax overhaul they passed in December. “He’s always defied political convention, but this is a political convention I think that we should adhere to,” said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, “which is to focus on that which is important to people, which is their wallet.” When House Speaker Paul D. Ryan hosted a meeting of major Republican donors in Austin, Tex., this month, the head of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the primary House G.O.P. super PAC, delivered a presentation with a plea that the party “must sell the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” to retain the House. Mr. Trump, though, has little appetite to carry a singular tax-cuts-and-the-economy argument and is grousing about what he sees as uninspired messaging by congressional leaders like Mr. Ryan. Appearing in West Virginia this month at an event meant to showcase the party’s tax agenda, Mr. Trump discarded his prepared remarks — even describing them as “boring” — and turned to more incendiary issues like immigration. Eric Beach, a Republican strategist who leads a pro-Trump political committee, Great America PAC, said Mr. Trump was rightly suspicious of the political formula favored by conventional Republican leaders like Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell. “He doesn’t think that’s how you win elections because that’s not how he won his election,” Mr. Beach said. “He knows and understands that the core issues of today are illegal immigration — including building the wall — and trade inequity.” Congressional leaders have left little doubt in private that they see Mr. Trump as a political millstone for many of the party’s candidates. In recent weeks, Mr. McConnell has confided to associates that Republicans may lose the Senate because of the anti-Trump energy on the left. And at Mr. Ryan’s retreat, a Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson, identified Mr. Trump as a major source of the party’s woes, according to multiple attendees. Ms. Anderson noted that his job approval was markedly weaker than past presidents, including President Barack Obama in the months before Democrats lost 63 House seats in the 2010 elections. Mr. Trump, for his part, has complained to associates about having been deployed to campaign for relatively weak Republicans like Roy S. Moore, who lost last year’s Senate race in Alabama, and Rick Saccone, who lost the special House election in Pennsylvania last month. He has taken the losses personally, particularly in Alabama, because the vacancy there was a result of his decision to make Jeff Sessions attorney general, an appointment he has since regretted. Mr. Trump has subsequently blamed others in the party for thrusting him into episodes of humiliating defeat. The scars from those races have made Mr. Trump reluctant to weigh in on the race that Senate Republicans most want his imprint on right now: the contest to replace Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who resigned this month. The president met this month with Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican appointee there and the favorite of the party establishment. Reflecting his fixation on personal loyalty, Mr. Trump quizzed Ms. Hyde-Smith on whether she had supported another candidate for president in 2016 before endorsing him. When Ms. Hyde-Smith said she had not, the president exclaimed that he needed more supporters like her in Washington, people briefed on the meeting said. But his staff pointedly told her not to request the president’s endorsement at the meeting. White House officials have created a series of fund-raising and organizational benchmarks that they want to see the new senator reach before they make a decision — a sign of how wary they are of entangling a president sensitive to political setbacks in elections that Republicans are not guaranteed to win. Despite the lingering disputes with congressional Republicans, White House officials say the president is eager to return to the campaign trail. Although some Republicans in competitive states may not want to appear with Mr. Trump — Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, for example, has told associates he is unlikely to campaign with the president — there is no lack of lawmakers eager for his help. Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, said he would welcome Mr. Trump on the trail anytime. “I would expect the president and vice president to be in congressional districts all across the country,” Mr. Zeldin said. “I’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback on the desire of the president’s team to be as helpful as possible.” Mr. Trump has also won praise on Capitol Hill for intervening in a handful of Senate races — including Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota and Ohio — that were threatening to grow messy. What has stunned Republican veterans outside the White House is how, even 15 months into his presidency, Mr. Trump still lacks any unified political organization. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff and a retired Marine general, has scant political acumen. And while the White House political staff has sought to bring a measure of order, curbing some of the president’s knee-jerk endorsement tendencies, Mr. Trump does not necessarily view them as his primary political counselors. This vacuum has, as is often the case with this White House, triggered fierce internecine scrapping among those vying for Mr. Trump’s ear. The president’s announcement that Brad Parscale, his 2016 digital guru, would manage his 2020 re-election campaign caught many of his most senior advisers by surprise, according to multiple Republicans. And the hasty decision immediately raised suspicions it was part of a power play by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, to isolate Corey Lewandowski, the president’s 2016 campaign manager and occasional adviser. Mr. Parscale has rankled Trump advisers by giving the president a perpetually rosy assessment of his poll numbers. He often tells Mr. Trump his numbers have “never been higher,” according to two advisers. Mr. Parscale has also irritated some Trump officials by attempting to take over the political portfolio, with his scheduling of meetings to devise an as-yet-unformed midterm strategy getting back to other factions. But his ascension marks only the newest power center in Mr. Trump’s political orbit: There is his White House staff, his vice president, the Republican National Committee, his family, his campaign alumni, his super PAC, his congressional allies, his conservative media friends and now his re-election team. All are expected to want a voice in Republican strategy for Mr. Trump in the midterms, adding only more chaos, as one White House official phrased it, to an already unruly presidency.

10,2018-04-29,Documentary Chronicles New York Times' Year Covering Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/28/us/ap-us-tribeca-new-york-times-documentary.html,894," By The Associated Press NEW YORK — Liz Garbus' first day shooting inside The New York Times newsroom was President Donald Trump's inauguration day. Her final day was April 16, when the Pulitzer Prizes announced the Times had won three of the coveted awards. In between, she spent more than a year documenting one of journalism's most distinguished institutions while it grappled with, and tirelessly reported on, an unprecedented presidency. From the first moments of ""The Fourth Estate"" — as Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet watches Trump sworn on a screen in the newsroom — there's the dramatic air of a gauntlet being thrown down. ""What a story,"" marvels Baquet. The first episode of ""The Fourth Estate"" premiered Saturday as the closing night film at the Tribeca Film Festival. It will air on Showtime beginning May 27. A bracing, real-life thriller with shades of ""All the President's Men"" (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross supply the propulsive soundtrack), the docu-series gives a rare view of the day-to-day toil of investigative journalists navigating an unpredictable and ceaseless story. And in giving such a window into the machinations of The New York Times, ""The Fourth Estate"" surely will give fodder to both supporters and critics of the newspaper. Trump has frequently attacked the press, but his gripes with ""the failing New York Times ,"" as he has repeatedly called it, have been especially pronounced. He recently called White House correspondent Maggie Haberman, who shared in one of the Pulitzers, a ""third-rate reporter"" and claimed he doesn't speak to her. Haberman, a key figure in the documentary, is seen interviewing Trump by phone in ""The Fourth Estate."" ""I honestly believe if people get a look inside the newsroom of the New York Times, it will only help us,"" Baquet said in an interview. ""It humanizes the New York Times. It shows our flaws, too. How could it not?"" said Baquet. ""But it shows a bunch of reporters and their editors struggling to cover a big story. It shows the impact it has on our daily lives when we do that. I think it shows us as regular people as opposed to arrogant, distant, whatever the worst is people think of us. I think it's good for the Times, and I think it's good for journalism."" Garbus, whose 2015 Nina Simone documentary ""What Happened, Miss Simone?"" was nominated for an Oscar, first conceived of the project while contemplating postelection subjects. When Trump, then president-elect, engaged with a back-and-forth with the Times over an interview at the newspaper's offices , a light bulb went off. ""I thought: Wow. Wouldn't it be great to be a fly on the wall of this president-elect meeting with his hometown newspaper that he constantly disparaged yet clearly craves its positive coverage? What an interesting dynamic, what an interesting relationship,"" Garbus said. Garbus initially reached out to the newspaper through a friend, Times Magazine writer Jonathan Maler. He introduced her to Sam Dolnick, an assistant editor, who brought the idea to Baquet. An agreement was quickly reached so Garbus could begin shooting by January. Participation would be up to individual reporters. If the cameras picked up a confidential source or something off-the-record, Garbus immediately deleted the footage. Baquet grants the newsroom was ""mixed"" on having cameras in its midst and that some found it intrusive. But many of the reporters frequently documented include some of the newspaper's page-one regulars: Michael S. Schmidt , Matt Apuzzo , Adam Goldman , Mark Mazzetti and Haberman . Many scenes focus on landing scoops and the newsroom conversations over framing a day's news. One scene captures Washington Bureau Chief Elisabeth Bumiller in a tense disagreement with editors in New York over coverage of the president's State of the Union address. Other scenes focus on the personal toll of keeping up with a relentless news cycle. ""I saw people struggling with questions of how to face a relentless assault on norms,"" Garbus said. ""And I saw investigative journalists faced with a story of a lifetime and at the top of their game. I saw human beings who are competitive by nature engaged in a dogfight."" The inner-workings of the Times have been documented before. In 2011's ""Page One: Inside The New York Times,"" filmmaker Andrew Rossi focused on the newspaper's media desk at a time of digital transformation. Though the Times' own review, by freelance writer Michael Kinsey, slammed the film as ""a mess,"" it helped establish the enduring cult of the late David Carr. His dressing down of Shane Smith, co-founder of media company Vice, remains a beloved defense of old-school journalism. Such transparency, Baquet said, ""helps build our credibility."" ""If people see Maggie Haberman go about her business and how much reporting she does, I think if people see the Washington bureau struggling with covering the daily news, it builds our credibility,"" he said. ""It lets people see how much work goes into it, the complexity. To be frank, it's a group of dedicated professions trying to do their jobs."" The beginning of ""The Fourth Estate"" captures the veteran newsman thrilled by the challenge of covering a Trump presidency. ""Great stories trump everything else, right?"" Baquet says. After a year and half of covering the administration, does he feel the same way? ""Do I think it trumps everything? Probably not,"" Baquet said, chuckling. ""It trumps a lot but probably not everything."" ___    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"

12,2018-04-29,China Eases Restrictions on Foreign Ownership of Securities Ventures,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/business/29reuters-china-regulation-finance.html,373," By Reuters BEIJING — China's securities regulator has released new guidelines for foreign investment in Chinese security joint ventures in which it eased some restrictions and launched an application process for more foreign ownership. The consultation period for the new rules that began in March is now over and the final regulations have been officially released for immediate implementation, the regulator said in an announcement on its website late on Saturday. During the review, restrictions limiting single foreign investors to a 30 percent stake in securities ventures, either directly or via a partner, were removed, according to the state-backed China Securities newspaper. Foreign bankers had expressed concern over this particular restriction, saying it might have required Western banks to include a third partner in deals which might stymie broadening international participation in China's domestic securities markets. Foreign firms that wish to make changes to their equity ownership in local securities joint ventures or that wish to establish a new joint venture can now apply to the regulator, it said in a question-and-answer published online. The move is one part of China's pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs to allow major international banks to bolster their presence in the securities business – from underwriting to trading - in the world's second-largest economy. Previously, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities joint ventures. That lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration.  The regulator also said that applications for owning up to 51 percent of local fund management companies are already being accepted, though added that this was unrelated to the changes in securities guidelines. It was unclear from the statement whether such applications are currently being accepted for all different types of Chinese fund management companies. Peter Alexander, director of Z-Ben Advisors, a Shanghai-based consultancy, said that Chinese policy makers have been signaling that the fund management policy change would come for over year, but global managers may not be prepared. ""What we have is only a move in policy. There is now the commercial task of actually buying a controlling stake and that task will neither be easy nor cheap,"" he said.

14,2018-04-29,Islamic State Ally Stakes Out Territory Around Lake Chad,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/world/africa/29reuters-nigeria-security.html,1296," By Reuters ABUJA/MAIDUGURI — From the shores of Lake Chad, Islamic State's West African ally is on a mission: winning over the local people. Digging wells, giving out seeds and fertilizer and providing safe pasture for herders are among the inducements offered by Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), which split from Nigeria's Boko Haram in 2016. ""If you are a herder, driver or trader, they won't touch you - just follow their rules and regulations governing the territory,"" said a herder, who moves cattle in and out of ISWA territory and whose identity Reuters is withholding for his safety. ""They don't touch civilians, just security personnel."" The campaign, which has created an economy for ISWA to tax, is part of the armed insurgent group's push to control territory in northeastern Nigeria and in Niger.  ISWA stretches farther and is more entrenched than officials have acknowledged, according to witnesses, people familiar with the insurgency, researchers and Western diplomats who have for the first time provided details of the group's growing efforts to establish a form of administration in the Lake Chad area. A map produced by the U.S. development agency in February and seen by Reuters shows how ISWA territory extends more than 100 miles into the northeastern Nigerian states of Borno and Yobe, where government has in many areas all but vanished after a decade of conflict.  The Islamists have not been defeated, as Nigeria says, and researchers say ISWA, less extreme than Boko Haram, has evolved into the dominant group. The U.S. map paints a similar picture, with ISWA operating in much of Borno.  ""Islamic State has a terrible reputation for being so brutal around the world, and people can't imagine an Islamic State faction could be more moderate (than Boko Haram),"" said Jacob Zenn, of The Jamestown Foundation in Washington D.C. The Lake Chad countries - Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon - have long neglected the region, allowing ISWA to create a stronghold from which to launch attacks. Its gains contrast with setbacks for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. It makes sense for ISWA to organize the local economy and raise taxes, said Vincent Foucher, who studies Boko Haram at the French National Centre for Science Research. ""It opens the longer game of trying to create a connection to people,"" he said, adding that if ISWA succeeds it may become a greater threat than Boko Haram. In 2015, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to finish off Boko Haram. Officials maintain this has been achieved, although the conflict continues into its tenth year. A presidency spokesman declined to comment for this story. ""THEY ARE NOT A GOVERNMENT"" Analysts estimate that ISWA has 3,000-5,000 fighters, about double Boko Haram's strength. But ISWA's territory is not completely secure. The Nigerian air force often bombs, and troops from Lake Chad countries attack the insurgents' domain around its shores and islands. Nigeria's armed forces ""just see them as Boko Haram,"" said Brigadier General John Agim, spokesman for the Nigerian military, at a briefing. ""We are not interested in the faction, what has that got to do with it?"" ""They are not a government, they kidnap girls from schools,"" Agim told Reuters in a separate interview. The military has announced an operation ""to totally destroy Boko Haram locations in the Lake Chad Basin"" - ISWA's domain - and end the insurgency within four months. But ISWA has so far proven intractable in its Lake Chad bases, where troops have been unable to make effective inroads, according to a Western diplomat who follows the group. The Nigerian military had ""completely lost the initiative against the insurgency,"" they said. The diplomat said ISWA was ready to cede less important areas because the military cannot hold them. ""However, they maintain absolute control over the islands and immediate areas near them where they train, live, etc."" The U.S., British and French militaries are helping regional governments with intelligence and training. Western officials declined, or did not respond to, requests for comment. ISWA protects locals from Boko Haram, something Nigeria's army cannot always do. That, according to one of the people with knowledge of the insurgency, has won the group local backing and eroded support for the military. ISWA is led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram's founder, Muhammed Yusuf, whose killing by police in 2009 sparked an Islamist insurgency in Nigeria that, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, has so far cost more than 34,000 lives. ISWA's leaders are low-profile, not appearing in videos or claiming responsibility for attacks, possibly to avoid the international media, and the ire of regional governments. Reuters was unable to contact the group for comment. This contrasts with the wholesale violence of Boko Haram under the publicity-hungry Abubakar Shekau, who has executed even close lieutenants. His group has strapped suicide bombs to women and children to attack civilians in mosques, markets and refugee camps. SPIES EVERYWHERE Boko Haram and ISWA are bloody rivals, but some travelers in ISWA territory feel safer than elsewhere in Nigeria's northeast. ""They have checkpoints for stop and search, and if you are a regular visitor they know you,"" said a second herder, adding that ISWA has spies everywhere, including informers who alert them to military attacks. He described seeing Islamic State's black flags and said preachers were used to win people over. Under ISWA, men must wear long beards, night-time movements are restricted, and prayers are compulsory, the herder said. Offenders can get 40 lashes. The herders said ISWA provides safe grazing for about 2,500 naira ($8) a cow and 1,500 naira ($5) for smaller animals. ISWA also runs slaughterhouses for the cattle, taking a cut for each animal, as well as from other activities like gathering firewood. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Maiduguri is the biggest city in Nigeria's northeast, the center of the military's fight against Boko Haram. But rural areas largely remain no-go zones for the authorities. It is there that ISWA is making its mark, offering people protection, particularly from Boko Haram. ""Al-Barnawi is sending people into IDP (displaced persons) camps to encourage people to return and farm, and the people are,"" said a person with knowledge of ISWA's activities. The person said Nigeria's military plays into the insurgents' hands by shutting down markets to deny supplies to the group, while ISWA encourages business. ""They are friendly and nice to those who come to the area, while they indoctrinate other people and sometimes they bring motorcycles for those who want to join them,"" a charcoal maker said. DISTANT RELATIONS Despite its name, experts believe ISWA's ties to Islamic State in the Middle East are limited. ""What's clear from ISWA primary source documents is that ISWA has asked IS for theological guidance on who it is lawful to attack,"" said Zenn. Daily activities, including military operations, are left to its own leaders, he said. Others say the insurgency lacks the broader appeal of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""ISWA is the largest IS affiliate, but it's very much a Nigerian organization. It doesn't have foreign fighters coming, it's hard to get to this place,"" said the Western diplomat. What fighters it does have can carry out targeted attacks, including the February kidnapping of 100 schoolgirls from the town of Dapchi, most later released without explanation, and a deadly raid on a Nigerian military base in March. But ISWA faces a dilemma: while wooing the population, it has harshly punished those who resist it, for example massacring dozens of fishermen last August, and this could hurt its standing with local people. ""It's important not to paint too rosy a picture,"" said Foucher, the researcher.

15,2018-04-29,Audit Finds Aramco Oil Reserves Slightly Higher Than Reported-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/business/29reuters-saudi-aramco-reserves.html,454," By Reuters DUBAI/LONDON — An audit of Saudi Aramco's oil reserves - an essential part of the preparatory work for its planned initial public offering - has found the state oil giant to have higher reserves than it previously reported, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Saudi Arabia’s reserves of easily recoverable oil have long been the world’s largest. Two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the independent external audit has found the proven oil reserves to be at least 270 billion barrels, which is slightly higher than the 260.8 billion barrels the company reported in its 2016 annual review.  Having an internationally recognised reserves audit has become a key task for Aramco as it seeks to become the world's most valuable company when it lists a 5 percent stake in an IPO later this year or early 2019. Aramco's official reserves figures were ""more than confirmed"" said one source. ""This is good for the company's valuation,"" another source said.  Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For nearly 30 years - despite rising production, large swings in oil prices and improved technology - Riyadh has annually reported the same number for reserves at around 261 billion barrels, according to BP's statistical review. A reserves total significantly above or below the 261 billion figure would likely affect Aramco’s potential market value in the listing and is being closely watched by investors. Dallas-based DeGolyer and MacNaughton, and Gaffney, Cline and Associates, part of Baker Hughes, are involved in the auditing, sources have said.  Baker Hughes and DeGolyer did not respond to a request for comment.  The sale of a stake in Aramco is a centrepiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. No decision about the location of the international share listing has been announced, fuelling market speculation the IPO could be delayed or shelved. But Prince Mohammad told Reuters in March the IPO could still take place at the end of 2018 or in early 2019, depending on financial market conditions. The New York stock exchange is in the running for the IPO, alongside London and Hong Kong, but Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has told Reuters that there was a risk of legal action if Aramco was listed in the United States. The Aramco board meets next in early May in Houston where they will review the latest IPO developments, sources said. Aramco said on Sunday it has appointed new members to its board including a female executive, a milestone for Saudi Arabia and the oil industry where there are few women executives.

16,2018-04-29,Injecting Drugs Can Ruin a Heart. How Many Second Chances Should a User Get?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/health/drugs-opioids-addiction-heart-endocarditis.html,3442," A life-threatening heart infection afflicts a growing number of people who inject opioids or meth. Costly surgery can fix it, but the addiction often goes unaddressed. By Abby Goodnough OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — Jerika Whitefield’s memories of the infection that almost killed her are muddled, except for a few. Her young children peering at her in the hospital bed. Her stepfather wrapping her limp arms around the baby. Her whispered appeal to a skeptical nurse: “Please don’t let me die. I promise, I won’t ever do it again.” Ms. Whitefield, 28, had developed endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves caused by bacteria that entered her blood when she injected methamphetamine one morning in 2016. Doctors saved her life with open-heart surgery, but before operating, they gave her a jolting warning: If she continued shooting up and got reinfected, they would not operate again. With meth resurgent and the opioid crisis showing no sign of abating, a growing number of people are getting endocarditis from injecting the drugs — sometimes repeatedly if they continue shooting up. Many are uninsured, and the care they need is expensive, intensive and often lasts months. All of this has doctors grappling with an ethically fraught question: Is a heart ever not worth fixing? “We’ve literally had some continue using drugs while in the hospital,” said Dr. Thomas Pollard, a veteran cardiothoracic surgeon in Knoxville, Tenn. “That’s like trying to do a liver transplant on someone who’s drinking a fifth of vodka on the stretcher.” The problem has consumed Dr. Pollard, a calm Texan who got his Tennessee medical license in 1996, just after the widely abused opioid painkiller OxyContin hit the market. He has seen an explosion of endocarditis cases, particularly among poor, young drug users whose hearts can usually be salvaged, but whose addiction goes unaddressed by a medical system that rarely takes responsibility for treating it. Certain cases haunt him. A little over a year ago, he replaced a heart valve in a 25-year-old man who had injected drugs, only to see him return a few months later. Now two valves, including the new one, were badly infected, and his urine tested positive for illicit drugs. Dr. Pollard declined to operate a second time, and the patient died at a hospice. “It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do,” he said. As cases have multiplied around the country, doctors who used to only occasionally encounter endocarditis in patients who injected drugs are hungry for guidance. A recent study found that at two Boston hospitals, only 7 percent of endocarditis patients who were IV drug users survived for a decade without reinfection or other complications, compared with 41 percent of patients who were not IV drug users. Those hospitals are among a small but growing group trying to be more proactive. Dr. Pollard has been lobbying hospital systems in Knoxville to provide addiction treatment for willing endocarditis patients, at least on a trial basis, after their surgery. If the hospitals offered it, he reasons, doctors would have more justification for turning away patients who refused and in the long run, hospitals would save money. Addiction has long afflicted rural east Tennessee, where the rolling hills and mountains are woven with small towns suffering from poverty and poor health. Prescribing rates for opioids are still strikingly high, and the overdose death rate in Roane County, where Ms. Whitefield lives, is three times the national average. Jobs go unfilled here because, employers say, applicants often cannot pass a drug test. Across Tennessee, some 163,000 poor adults remain uninsured after state lawmakers refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. For them, and even for many covered by Medicaid, as Ms. Whitefield is, evidence-based opioid addiction treatment remains meager. More common are cash-only clinics, or abstinence-based programs that bank on willpower instead of the addiction medications that have proved more effective. Treatment for endocarditis usually involves up to six weeks of intravenous antibiotics, often in the hospital because doctors are wary of sending addicted patients home with IV lines for fear they would use them to inject illicit drugs. Many, like Ms. Whitefield, also need intricate surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. The cost can easily top $150,000, Dr. Pollard said. Advice from specialty groups, like the American Association for Thoracic Surgery and the American College of Cardiology, about when to operate remains vague. For now, “it’s just a lot of anecdote — surgeons talking to each other, trying to determine when we should and when we shouldn’t,” said Dr. Carlo Martinez, who is one of Dr. Pollard’s partners and who operated on Ms. Whitefield at Methodist Medical Center of Oak Ridge. Their practice, owned by Covenant Health, will almost always operate on someone with a first-time case of endocarditis from injecting drugs, Dr. Pollard said. But repeat infections, when the damage can be more extensive and harder to fix, make it a tougher call. Dr. Mark Browne, Covenant’s senior vice president and chief medical officer, said, “Each patient is evaluated individually and decisions regarding the appropriate course of care are determined by their attending physician.” In the nearly two years since she got sick, Ms. Whitefield has felt physically diminished and been prone to illness. She also feels harshly judged by a medical system that saved her life but often treats her with suspicion and disdain. Over the same stretch of time, Dr. Pollard has grown increasingly disillusioned with hospitals that consider addiction treatment beyond their purview, and haunted by the likelihood that many of his drug-addicted patients will die young whether they get heart surgery or not. He set up a task force in 2016 to address the problem but has faced obstacles, especially concerning cost and, he believes, a societal reluctance to spend money on people who abuse drugs. “Everybody has sympathy for babies and children,” he said. “No one wants to help the adult drug addict because the thought is they did this to themselves.” ____ Ms. Whitefield, a talkative young woman with brooding eyes, goes by the nickname Shae. She started on opioid painkillers as a teenager suffering from endometriosis, a disorder of the uterine tissue, and interstitial cystitis, a painful bladder condition. She got the opioids from doctors for years, and eventually from friends. She and her high school boyfriend, Chris Bunch, had three children by the time she was 26. She trained to become a licensed practical nurse but dropped out of the program when her oldest son, Jayden, got seriously ill as a baby. The family lives in a tiny town that Mr. Bunch, now Ms. Whitefield’s husband, described as “country, country, country.” In 2015, after their daughter, Kyzia, was born, Ms. Whitefield sank into postpartum depression. She was obsessively worried about shielding Kyzia from sexual abuse and other traumas she had experienced as a child. She started injecting crushed opioid pills and occasionally meth, savoring the needle’s sting — she had an old habit of cutting herself to provide relief from emotional pain — at least as much as the high. After sharing a needle with one of her brothers that day in June 2016, Ms. Whitefield started shivering and sweating. A fever soon followed, and she lay for almost a week on the couch, thinking she had a kidney infection. She was delirious by the time Jayden, then 8, woke her stepfather one morning and told him to call 911. She arrived at Methodist Medical Center of Oak Ridge with full-blown sepsis, floating in and out of consciousness. Her organs had started to shut down. At home, she had stared at a picture on the wall of her grandmother faintly smiling, a source of reassurance, for days. When the first nurse leaned over her in the emergency room, she thought she smelled her grandmother’s perfume. Her stepfather, Brian Mignogna, remembers being stunned when a doctor who initially assessed her said that if it were up to him, he would not go to great lengths to save her. “He said once someone’s been shooting up, you go through all this money and surgery and they go right back to shooting up again, so it’s not worth it,” Mr. Mignogna recalled. “I was just dumbfounded.” Dr. Martinez was the on-call heart surgeon a few days later, though, and felt strongly about taking Ms. Whitefield’s case. Her children and stepfather had been constants at her bedside, and unlike some patients he had seen, she had readily admitted to her drug use. He believed her when she said she had not been injecting for long and wanted to stop. “She was a young mother and her family was involved; her father was there,” he said. “To me, it seemed she had that social support that patients need once they recover from this.” Ms. Whitefield also had health coverage through Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor, because she has young children. It paid for her care, whereas if she were uninsured, the hospital would have had to cover the cost. Antibiotics cleared the infection that initially led her to the hospital, but she ended up needing surgery two months later. Her mitral valve was so damaged that she had begun showing signs of heart failure. Dr. Martinez was compassionate, but he stressed that the surgery would be “a one-time deal,” Mr. Mignogna recalled. “The way he put it was, ‘You relapse and end up with another infection, we won’t treat you again,’” Mr. Mignogna said. Dr. Martinez repaired Ms. Whitefield’s mitral valve in a three-hour operation. It involved sawing open her breastbone, connecting her to a bypass machine to keep blood flowing through her body, and then stopping her heart and fixing the valve. He reinforced it with a small plastic ring before restarting her heart and closing her up. She had written a note to each of her children — wise Jayden, kind Elijah, strong-willed Kyzia — in case she never woke up. Two weeks later, she was well enough to go home. She soon began seeing a counselor at a clinic unaffiliated with the hospital system and taking buprenorphine, a medication that diminishes opioid cravings and has been found to reduce the risk of relapse and fatal overdose. Ms. Whitefield has had occasional cravings since the surgery but says she has not used drugs again, traumatized by the memory of her ordeal. “I know next time God might not save me,” she said quietly. “They will not treat me for a second time if I have track marks or anything like that.” As she recuperated, Ms. Whitefield started thinking about returning to school, aspiring to become a drug and alcohol counselor or real estate agent, or both. She has also started serving as an advocate of sorts for others in her community who get endocarditis or other infections from injecting, driving them to the emergency room or sharing every detail of the protocol that saved her. She smarts at the thought of providing only “comfort care” — antibiotics but no surgery — even if a patient refuses addiction treatment. “When do you stop wanting to save a life?” she asked. “If you have that ability, who’s to say you shouldn’t use it? I see it from their standpoint — not wanting to repeat the same game. But it’s hard, you know? This isn’t an easy disease to break away from.” ____ Dr. Pollard, a quietly driven high school valedictorian, used to have no empathy for drug-addicted patients. “I was like everyone else: ‘They do it to themselves, they deserve what they get,’” he said. “But then when you see their children, and hear about friends my kids went to school with who have died, it’s closer to home.” When he became president of the Knoxville Academy of Medicine in 2015, he came up with the idea of the city’s hospital systems teaming up to offer addiction treatment to endocarditis patients. He had the perfect platform to push for it, he thought. So the following year, he set up a task force that included people from each hospital system — his own, Covenant Health; the University of Tennessee Medical Center; and Tennova Healthcare — as well as from two drug treatment centers and some community groups. At a task force meeting last August, about a year after Ms. Whitefield’s surgery, Dr. Pollard clicked through a PowerPoint presentation full of data a research nurse had compiled. From 2014 through 2016, the three hospital systems in Knoxville had provided valve surgery to 117 patients diagnosed with endocarditis from injecting drugs. Ten had received a second surgery after becoming reinfected; of those, two had received a third. Just over half the patients were uninsured, and only 1 percent had private coverage. From the data, it was impossible to know if anyone had been reinfected but turned away by doctors. But at least 21 people — 18 percent — had died since their heart surgery, typically from sepsis or respiratory failure, which Dr. Pollard said indicated reinfection. The group discussed Dr. Pollard’s proposal for Cornerstone of Recovery, an addiction treatment center here, to admit a handful of endocarditis patients as soon as they were cleared for discharge. Cornerstone would provide several months of inpatient treatment and up to a year’s worth of Vivitrol, a monthly $1,000 shot that blocks cravings and helps prevent relapse. Buprenorphine, the medication Ms. Whitefield takes, is less expensive. But Cornerstone does not provide it because it is an opioid itself and “is trading one for the other,” said Webster Bailey, its executive director of marketing. Many addiction experts have called that view “grossly inaccurate.” They say it is weaker than drugs like oxycodone and heroin, activating the brain’s opioid receptors enough to ease cravings but not enough to provide a high in people who are already dependent on opioids. Patients would sign an agreement stating that if they returned to abusing drugs after addiction treatment, they might not be considered a candidate for future heart surgery. The total cost per patient: perhaps $55,000, which Dr. Pollard hopes that government and private funding would help cover if the program expanded. “This should be part of the treatment, just like antibiotics are,” he told the group. A surgeon from Tennova dryly pointed out: “Not everybody in that group is going to say, ‘This is for me, I’m going to do it.’” Still, the group decided Dr. Pollard should take the next step, pitching the pilot plan to each system’s top executives. “We are competing systems, but this is a common enemy that unites us all,” he said afterward. “We need a united policy.” By spring, Dr. Pollard said, he was close to persuading Covenant Health to pay for five initial endocarditis patients to get addiction treatment after their hospital stays — if its competitors did the same. But Dr. Browne, Covenant’s chief medical officer, was noncommital in a written statement, saying that “due to the high cost of residential and outpatient treatment, no commitments have been made to proceed.” Dr. Jerry Epps, chief medical officer at UT Medical Center, said in an interview that the proposal was “a big ask,” adding, “The hospitals are already paying a huge part of the financial burden for this patient population.” His hospital was so overwhelmed by addicted patients who continued using or seeking illicit drugs during their stays, he said, that it now requires patients admitted for infections because of IV drug use to surrender their cellphones and have no guests for the first week of their stay. (There were 284 such patients between mid-August and mid-April, for endocarditis as well as soft tissue and bone infections.) Covenant has adopted a similar policy, Dr. Browne said. Dr. Pollard will not see his project to completion. With the last of their children off to college, he and his wife have decided to move home to San Antonio, where he has mentioned his idea to his new practice. After 22 years in Knoxville, they will leave next month. “In some ways I’m disappointed,” he said of the lack of movement. “But it’s been forward progress, and I do think something will happen, probably this year.” “If we can just get the pilot study done, people will begin to notice.” ____ Ms. Whitefield left home one morning late last summer, driving past a church with a sign that read, “Jesus Heals Broken Hearts.” She was visiting Jennifer Stringfield, an office manager in Dr. Pollard’s practice who had become a mentor to her after her surgery. She was upset about feeling tired all the time; about the harsh judgment she felt emanated from most doctors and nurses she encountered; about more people she knew who had died from endocarditis — unnecessarily, she believed. “I know of a girl, she had it two or three days before I brought her to the hospital, but her case wasn’t nowhere near as severe as mine,” she said, as Ms. Stringfield patted her arm. “They gave her 12 hours’ worth of antibiotics and said it wasn’t working. They quit; put her on comfort care. She lived almost two weeks.” “There might have been reasons you didn’t know about,” Ms. Stringfield insisted softly. “I think most doctors fight for you all to live; I really do.” Ms. Stringfield checks in with Ms. Whitefield from time to time and takes her calls when she needs to vent or starts thinking about opioids. “Sometimes I’ll call her and she don’t even know I’m having a craving,” Ms. Whitefield said. “We’ll talk about the kids or something, and she gets me through those 15 minutes.” She considers Ms. Stringfield a rarity — someone in the medical field who is not judgmental about addiction. That may be because some of her family members — a cousin, an uncle, her stepfather — have struggled with it. “It could be anybody,” Ms. Stringfield said. “I don’t care how you’re raised.” Ms. Whitefield’s daughter was getting restless in her lap, so she hugged Ms. Stringfield goodbye. “I love you, too,” Ms. Stringfield said. “Call me.” One recent morning, Ms. Whitefield waited anxiously to see her cardiologist, Dr. Larry Justice, about the results of some tests from the previous month. On her chest, her thin pink surgery scar stretched from the V-neck of her shirt to her collarbone. She ticked off her latest problems to a nurse: weakness, occasional chest pains, trouble sleeping, feeling cold all the time. She was worried, too, about the hepatitis C — another rampant problem among people who inject drugs — she had not been able to treat. “I don’t have a primary care doctor,” Ms. Whitefield said. “Nobody will see me because of my drug use history.” Dr. Justice arrived with good news: There was no evidence of endocarditis in her blood, and her repaired mitral valve looked good. But another result was troubling. “One of your other valves is leaking a fair amount,” Dr. Justice said, and added: “I can’t guarantee you won’t need another valve surgery.”” Ms. Whitefield stared at him, stunned. “Endocarditis causes the most intense inflammation on your body that you can imagine,” Dr. Justice reminded her. “I just want to live to see my kids grow up,” she choked out. She would not be denied a second surgery under these circumstances. But she desperately feared the prospect. Even when she had cut her leg recently while cleaning her garage, she had been terrified that bacteria would find its way back to her heart. “Don’t feel like you’re just waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Dr. Justice said, calling her “really pretty miraculous” for not relapsing since the surgery. The praise seemed to sail past her. Back at home, she sobbed quietly as her daughter and two other toddlers, the children of a visiting friend, wandered around dim rooms. The clouds were wispy over the dark, bare mountains outside her windows. Ms. Whitefield’s thoughts were racing. Should she tell her children, who worried about her enough as it was? Get a second opinion? “First off, I’m going to call my counselor,” she murmured. “Definitely going to get my will written up and established, too.” The used car she had bought, a 2008 Saturn, had broken down and there was no money to fix it. Her husband had wrenched his back the night before and was in so much pain he was in bed, vomiting. Still, Dr. Justice had referred her to a gastrointestinal specialist so she could finally see about treating her hepatitis. And with her counselor, she was working on healthy ways of coping with stress, like journaling and hot baths. She had not had a craving for weeks. “I’m trying to think of ways to get myself more hope here,” she said. Up on the wall, her grandmother faintly smiled.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
17,2018-04-29,Top Sainsbury's Shareholder QIA Backs Asda Takeover Talks-Source,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/business/29reuters-sainsbury-walmart-m-a-qatar.html,335," By Reuters DUBAI/LONDON — Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the biggest shareholder in J Sainsbury Plc, is supportive of merger talks between the British supermarket chain and rival Walmart Inc's Asda, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Sainsbury's statement regarding the discussions on Monday will reflect QIA's position on the matter, the source said. Sainsbury's declined to comment on Sunday. QIA, one of the 10 largest sovereign funds in the world, has a 22 percent stake in Sainsbury's, which said on Saturday it was in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the UK's No. 2 and 3 grocers. It has tried to buy Sainsbury's before with other partners. Supermarkets' market share graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2cZQkWZ Britain's big grocers, including No. 4 player Morrisons, have been losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and must also deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the march of Amazon. Tesco last month moved to strengthen its grip on the UK food sector, completing the 4 billion-pound purchase of wholesaler Booker. Bernstein Research said in a research note the Tesco-Booker deal made Sainsbury & Asda fall further behind on scale. Together their combined market share would slightly surpass Tesco's market share, which would drive buying synergies, it said in the note.  The source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, did not comment on whether the deal would dilute QIA's stake in Sainsbury's or the size of its potential stake in the combined group. QIA's chief executive was recently quoted as saying the fund has not been liquidating foreign assets to support the Gulf state's banking system since other Arab countries imposed an embargo on Qatar last June. Sheikh Abdullah bin Mohamed bin Saud al-Thani said the fund, with assets unofficially estimated at about $300 billion (217.63 billion pounds), did not need to sell foreign assets to raise cash, and indeed was about to announce ""the deal of a lifetime"".

18,2018-04-29,U.S.-Backed Forces Say They Regain Villages Seized by Syrian Army,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/29reuters-mideast-crisis-syria-euphrates.html,615," By Reuters AMMAN — U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces said they expelled had Syrian troops that briefly took control of a string of villages in oil rich areas east of the Euphrates river near the Iraqi border on Sunday.  SDF forces led by the Kurdish YPG militia said they had waged a counter-attack against Syrian troops it said were backed by Russian forces, adding they were driven ""far away"" from four villages they had seized earlier in the day. ""Our forces regained the initiative,"" they said in a statement. It did not say if the U.S. coalition took part in the operation. Washington has a strong military presence in the area in eastern Syria which holds the bulk of the country's oil and gas reserves, according to regional diplomatic sources. A U.S. army statement sent to Reuters confirmed the attack on SDF forces by what it called pro-regime forces near Deir al-Zor city and said the ""coalition used established deconfliction channels to de-escalate the situation"", without elaborating. ""The coalition remains committed to our SDF partners in the campaign to defeat Daesh (Islamic State) in eastern Syria,"" the statement added. A Western diplomatic source earlier told Reuters U.S. coalition jets from bases in northern Syria hit the attacking forces which were believed to include Iranian-backed militias operating in Deir al-Zor area. Iranian-backed forces led by Iraqi and Lebanese Hezbolah Shi'ite militias played a major role in defeating the militants last year in eastern Syria.  A source in the SDF also confirmed coalition forces had intervened. Earlier, the Syrian army said it had captured a string of villages east of the Euphrates near the border with Iraq held by Kurdish-led forces, state television said. It gave no explanation for the move. The U.S.-backed proxy forces spearheaded by the YPG since last year control much of the territory east of the Euphrates in Deir al-Zor province as part of a major aerial and ground campaign led by the Pentagon that drove Islamic State militants from eastern Syria and their former de facto capital Raqqa.  The Russian-backed Syrian army has rarely clashed with SDF forces in its campaign against Islamic State and had kept away from their areas east of the Euphrates, focusing on regaining territory from the militants west of the river. There have been elaborate ""deconfliction lines"" separating the coalition forces on the eastern side of the river from the Russian and Iranian backed forces on the western side to prevent clashes, U.S army officials and defence analysts say.  In February, U.S. airstrikes killed and wounded hundreds of pro-government forces including Russian paramilitary contractors advancing near the eastern city of Deir al-Zor towards one of the largest gas fields in the hands of U.S.-backed forces. Before the announcement that the Syrian army had taken control of the villages, the SDF said they were engaged in heavy clashes with Syrian army troops on the outskirts of the village of Janin near the Euphrates. They accused Syrian authorities of seeking to disrupt preparations by the U.S.-led coalition to resume an imminent offensive against Islamic State in several pockets of territory along the middle Euphrates River Valley that they still control. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday he expected a ""re-energized"" effort against Islamic State militants in eastern Syria in the coming days. U.S. officials have said that in recent days they have seen SDF fighters returning to the area of the Euphrates where the militants operate to relaunch new operations against them. The Kurdish-led militia has blamed a Turkish offensive in Afrin against it for diverting efforts away from the fight against the militants.

19,2018-04-29,Syrian Troops Briefly Take Villages East of Euphrates River,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html,883," By The Associated Press BEIRUT — Syrian government forces on Sunday briefly captured four villages east of the Euphrates River in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour after rare clashes with U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters, then lost the area in a counteroffensive by the Kurdish-led force. The area close to the border with Iraq has been the site of recent clashes between the two sides that had been focusing on fighting the Islamic State extremist group. The IS had declared its caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq. Crossings into the east bank of the Euphrates in eastern Syria by government forces have been rare. Hours later, Syrian state television reported airstrikes it described as a ""new aggression,"" with missiles targeting a number of military outposts in northern Syria. Syrian TV reported early Monday that the missiles targeted outposts in the Hama and Aleppo countryside. It did not say who fired the missiles or whether there were any casualties or damage. The news comes less than two weeks after a similar report of airstrikes on government military installations in the central Homs region and the suburbs of Damascus. But the military later said a false alarm had set off air defense systems. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria through activists on the ground, reported loud explosions in the Hama countryside and Aleppo province resulting from missiles targeting a base of the 47th Brigade in Hama that houses Syrian government and allied Iranian forces. It also reported missiles hitting positions near the Nairab air base and Aleppo airport. It said the source of the missiles was not immediately known, and had no information on casualties. Earlier this month, seven Iranian military personnel were killed in an airstrike on Syria's T4 air base in the central Homs province. Syria, Iran and Russia blamed Israel for that attack. Israel, which has frequently targeted what it says are weapons shipments to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in Syria, did not confirm or deny it. The U.S., Britain and France also carried out joint airstrikes on Syrian government facilities April 13, in retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town near Damascus they blamed on President Bashar Assad's government. There was no immediate comment from Israel or the United States. State news agency SANA said the villages briefly captured by government forces Sunday were held by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, adding that they are close to the provincial capital, also called Deir el-Zour. The SDF said in a statement later that it regained control of the whole area it earlier lost. Much of Deir el-Zour province was held by the Islamic State group but over the past year Syrian government forces captured most areas west of the Euphrates while SDF fighters took areas east of the river. On Feb. 7, pro-Syrian government fighters attacked SDF positions east of the river and faced a ferocious U.S. counterattack that left dozens, including Russians, dead. SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel said in a statement earlier Sunday that the Syrian army attack coincided with ""our forces' preparations to complete the Island Storm campaign"" to liberate the remaining areas east of the river from IS. Gabriel said the Syrian army and pro-government fighters began targeting SDF fighters to impede ""the launching of our campaign against terrorism. Our forces are responding in self-defense."" ""We affirm that we are determined to eradicate terrorism from its roots and to assert our right to self-defense,"" Gabriel said about IS. ""We consider this aggression by regime forces to be a support for terrorism and falls within the attempts to impede the war on terrorism."" The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said Sunday's offensive left six SDF fighters dead and 22 wounded adding that there were also casualties on the government side. Gabriel issued another statement later saying all the area lost earlier was regained by SDF fighters. He said Syrian troops were backed by Russian fighters adding that after the SDF's counteroffensive, government forces ""are now far away."" The Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said SDF fighters took back most of the area except for one village. The fighting in eastern Syria came as Syrian state media and the Observatory reported that an agreement was reached between the Syrian government and several rebel factions to evacuate the last three rebel-held suburbs of the capital Damascus. SANA said the deal will let opposition fighters who want to evacuate the area head to rebel-held regions while those who decide to stay can hand over their weapons and benefit from an amnesty. The Observatory said rebels who will leave will head to the northwestern province of Idlib, the northern town of Jarablus, and the southern province of Daraa that borders Jordan. The three suburbs of Babila, Beit Sahem and Yalda have been held by rebels for years and their capture would bring all suburbs of the capital under government control. The agreement came as government forces captured more areas from the IS in the nearby Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk and the neighborhood of Hajar al-Aswad. SANA said troops captured most of the Qadam neighborhood as well as the Assali and Joura quarters in Hajar Aswad. ___ Associated Press writers Zeina Karam in Beirut and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.

20,2018-04-29,Iran Confirms Holding British-Iranian Academic on Security Charges,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/29reuters-iran-britain-detainee.html,294," By Reuters DUBAI — Iran confirmed on Sunday that it had arrested a British-Iranian academic on security charges, state media reported, the latest in a string of arrests of dual nationals in the Islamic Republic over the past few years. On Wednesday, the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested Abbas Edalat, a British-Iranian national who is a professor of computer science at Imperial College in London, in mid-April. Asked about reports of Edalat's detention, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi told reporters in Tehran: ""I confirm his arrest on security charges, but I am unable to give details,"" according to state broadcaster IRIB. The semi-official news agency Fars reported on Thursday that Edalat was part of an ""infiltration network affiliated with Britain"" whose members had been detained. Britain's Foreign Office (FCO) has said it is urgently seeking information from Iran about Edalat's arrest. CHRI said Edalat had traveled to Iran from his home in London at an unknown date for academic purposes. Quoting an unnamed source, it said the Guards had confiscated a computer, CDs and notebooks from Edalat when he was arrested. At least three other British-Iranian dual citizens are known to be held in the Islamic Republic. Edalat is a founder of the U.S.-based Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran (CASMII), an advocacy group that opposes foreign intervention in the Islamic Republic, according to CHRI. The Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals since 2015, most for alleged espionage, Reuters reported in November. According to former prisoners, families of current ones and diplomats, in some cases the dual detainees are being held for use in prisoner swaps with Western countries. Iran denies this.

21,2018-04-29,Syrian Army Tightens Noose Around Palestinian Camp,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/29/world/middleeast/29reuters-mideast-crisis-syria-camp.html,652," By Reuters AMMAN — Syrian troops tightened the noose on Sunday around a Palestinian refugee camp held by Islamic State militants in southern Damascus where hundreds of civilians face an uncertain future, state media, witnesses and residents said. Nearly two weeks into a campaign to capture the last area near the capital outside government control that has left many parts of the once-teeming Yarmouk camp in ruins, state media said that the al Qadm neighbourhood next to the camp was retaken. Opposition sources said the army was now engaged in fierce fighting with militants on the outskirts of Yarmouk camp where an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 militants are encircled. The militants who are besieged in an ever-shrinking area have repelled successive raids to enter their heavily defended stronghold. State television and the official SANA news agency said a deal had reportedly been reached between the army and ""terrorist groups"" in the camp to allow them safe passage to the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib in return for the evacuation of civilians in two besieged Shi'ite villages in the province. It said the deal's implementation would begin on Monday with buses arriving at the entrance of the camp.  It did not say which rebel groups were included, but a rebel source said the deal was with the militant Tahrir al Sham, spearheaded by Syria's former al Qaeda offshoot, which has about 200 fighters in the camp. Although Islamic State jihadists, the main insurgent group in the camp, have vowed to continue to fight, the surrender of their comrades in arms could hasten a similar deal, two opposition sources said.  The Yarmouk campaign is part of a wider Russian-backed offensive to regain the last pocket in opposition hands around the capital after retaking eastern Ghouta this month. It has shown no sign of letting up since Western countries launched air strikes on April 14 to punish the government for a suspected poison gas attack. SICK AND ELDERLY The fate of hundreds of Palestinians, mostly sick and elderly women and children still in the camp that was once the largest in Syria, is uncertain. UNRWA, the U.N body responsible for Palestinian refugees, has called on warring parties to spare civilians. ""There are some families that have been buried under the rubble and no one is able to retrieve their bodies,"" said Abu Osama, a resident who fled the camp two days ago to nearby Yalda, joining thousands of others seeking relative safety there since the start of the latest offensive. ""The regime is just burning and destroying ... and then trying to advance on several fronts,"" said Rami al Sayed, a former resident of Yarmouk who is now on its outskirts. The camp, which has been under siege by the army since rebels captured it in 2012, was home to some 160,000 Palestinians before the Syrian conflict began in 2011, refugees from the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and their descendents. Amaq, a news agency affiliated to Islamic State, said its fighters had repelled the latest attacks on their positions in al Qadam and Hay al Tadamon, killing at least 17 army fighters killed in sniper attacks. The ultra-hardline Sunni militants also pushed overnight into some positions in the southern Damascus pocket where mainly mainstream rebels operating under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) are in control, opposition sources said. A deal was reached overnight under Russian auspices to evacuate those FSA rebels based in the towns of Yalda, Babila and Beit Sahem that adjoin Islamic State-held areas to opposition held areas in northern Syria, a rebel source said confirming leaks in state media. Those rebels who have in the past fought both the militants and the Syrian army have also been targeted by the army in an attempt to force them to capitulate.

Melissa Clark brought forth a terrific new recipe this week for chicken in ginger-scallion sauce (above). She picked it up from our colleague Jade Zimmerman, whose mom made a version of the dish when Jade was growing up. I think you should make that recipe tonight because once you’ve tried it I’ll bet that you’re going to want to make it all the time. Eventually you’ll start experimenting: pouring the sauce over roasted fish, or steamed clams, or crisp-grilled pork chops. Jade’s chicken in ginger-scallion sauce will lead you in all sorts of fascinating directions. Start that journey today. It’s simple cooking. Which should leave plenty of time today to explore our collection of recipes for our best chocolate chip cookies. Choose your favorite and see if you can execute a batch or two to take to work on Monday, or down to the activity center, to give to teachers at school, to offer neighbors who don’t get out much, to share with your crew, wherever it assembles. Baking for others can be as much a joy for the baker as for those who get the sweets. Monday night, how about cooking asparagus with brown butter? You could add some sliced almonds to the dish and serve it with rice and call that dinner. Or you could pair the vegetables as written with roasted chicken thighs. Or you could make the chicken as written and prepare the asparagus differently; we have a whole guide to asparagus and how to cook it well on NYT Cooking. Avail yourself of it, then cook your spears. I like the notion of stir-fried beef and sugar snap peas for a Tuesday night supper. Maybe you will, too. For Wednesday night, one of the hardest of the week to muster up the energy to cook, try to keep things simple: Use Melissa’s 20-minute recipe for a sheet-pan dinner of spicy shrimp with broccoli rabe, eat it with torn bread and ferocious intent, then head off to bed to watch “Sing Street” for the 3,000th time. Chicken under a brick for dinner on Thursday night, with a cucumber and tomato salad with cilantro and mint. (As Mark Bittman points out for the chicken, you don’t actually need a brick to make it. You can use a second cast-iron skillet instead, or an inverted plate with something heavy placed on top of it.) And then we’ll round out the week with pan-roasted salmon with jalapeños and a broccoli salad with garlic and sesame, head into the weekend feeling good about just about everything. How’s that? You can find thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week on NYT Cooking. You will need to sign up for a subscription to access them. But we think that’s a good deal, fair value. With a subscription, you can use our site and apps not just as a source of recipes but as a repository for ones that you find elsewhere, as I did the other day when I put this recipe for a Filipino chicken inasal, from Sunset, into my recipe box. (Here’s how to do that yourself.) You can even send yourself grocery lists. Hey, just reading the notes that follow the recipes is almost worth the price of admission. People get up to some interesting business, in our world. And remember: We are standing by to help if anything goes wrong along the way, either with a recipe or with the technology. Just write us at cookingcare@nytimes.com. We’ll scramble a helo and get to you soon as we can. Now, a few miles away from the cultured butter and ras el hanout, Longreads has posted an excerpt from Charles Bowden’s new biography of Edward Abbey. It’ll make you want to head to the desert and drive. You know what’s going to be fun? “Crazy Rich Asians.” Finally, why don’t you check out this preview of “Like Life: Sculpture, Color and the Body (1300-Now),” at the Met Breuer.

A statement by the National Oil Corporation said Sunday one other person was injured in the crash, about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) southwest of the Sharara oil field. It said the aircraft belongs to the Libyan Air Force but was chartered by Akakus Oil, which operates the Sharara field. Oil is Libya's only real source of revenue. The North African country has been trying to rebuild the industry, though it remains but a shadow of the 1.6 billion barrels a day it produced in 2011. Libya was plunged into chaos following the 2011 uprising and is now split between rival governments, each backed by an array of militias.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"

28,2018-04-30,WPP's First Results After Sorrell Boost Sentiment and Shares,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-wpp-outlook.html,853," By Reuters LONDON — The two men running WPP following the shock exit of Martin Sorrell said they would look at restructuring the group and may sell parts of it as better than expected results provided a positive start to life without the company founder. Digital boss Mark Read and acquisitions specialist Andrew Scott used first-quarter results from the world's biggest advertising group to outline their initial plans to counter lower customer spending and huge technological upheaval. Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta, who oversaw the departure of industry veteran Sorrell two weeks ago after an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct, said he had asked the two executives to work on their strategy while a hunt for a new CEO continues.  Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its market research arm Kantar or even go as far as a full break up of a business built up by Sorrell over more than three decades and now valued at around 15 billion pounds. A person familiar with the matter said WPP, owner of ad agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, had been contacted by one private equity group and a venture capital firm expressing interest in the Kantar business if WPP ever decides to sell. ""We are facing a challenging environment,"" Quarta said. ""I want to reiterate that Mark and Andrew have mine and the board's full backing to review the strategy, make recommendations to the board and then execute.  ""We will be keeping an open mind and will always go where value is for shareholders but the starting point is not a break up."" BETTER THAN FEARED Quarta and his executive team were helped by the fact the quarterly sales were not as bad as feared, boosting WPP shares as much as 9 percent. Organic net sales slipped only 0.1 percent -- compared with a 1 to 1.5 percent drop that analysts had forecast.  But WPP, which provides advertising, data and market research to the likes of Ford, Unilever and Vodafone through its 200,000 staff in 112 countries, is still trailing peers Omnicom, Publicis and IPG. Read, the joint chief operating officer, said he did not underestimate the challenges ahead.  ""We are not complacent about what we need to do and we recognise that we need to get the top-line growing more quickly,"" Read told Reuters in an interview.  ""There are structural shifts in the industry and we need to have more of a structural response, (but) we are an industry in structural change, not structural decline."" CHANGING TIMES WPP was particularly hit by the lower spending from consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G, the trend of some clients to create marketing in house and by the upheaval sparked by the growth of Google and Facebook who can help clients to cut out the middle-man of the advertising groups.  WPP said in March it did not expect to grow in 2018 and it reiterated that on Monday.  Read said he had spoken to the group's top 20 clients since Sorrell's departure and had been reassured that they were not looking to ditch the British company.  He said however that clients wanted a more integrated offering from WPP after years of dealing with its multiple agencies. Recent events such as a Facebook data scandal and the presence of ads next to extremist online content showed the importance of an independent advertising voice, he added.  ""Clients need an independent source of advice in how to navigate this new digital environment,"" he said. Scott said the group would look to dispose some minority assets with funds raised going towards the faster growing parts of the business, such as data, technology and digital services.  Signs that the group is moving ahead with its strategy and better-than-expected trading in China and Brazil put the shares on course for their best single gain ever and mean the stock has regained the losses it incurred when Sorrell stepped down. HARD TO REPLACE The 73-year-old Sorrell, who built the group from a two-man outfit in 1985 to dominate the industry, remains a hard act to follow however and Chairman Quarta faced questions over his handling of the April 14 departure from analysts.  WPP did not give any details of the allegation against Sorrell who denied the charges. Quarta said on Monday that Sorrell had quit after the investigation had concluded but before the board had considered its implications. ""The matter...was really what we consider to be a matter of privacy and therefore is a matter for Martin and hence the reason why we did not disclose,"" he said. Analysts spoken to by Reuters said the team of Read and Scott, backed by Quarta, finance director Paul Richardson and transformation officer Lindsay Pattison, had presented a joined up strategy while the improved results will boost sentiment. Liberum media analyst Ian Whittaker said the executive team had sought to explain the restructuring already done while stating that the more bearish suggestions of industry decline were exaggerated. ""There is nothing that suggests WPP is significantly behind the curve relative to other agencies,"" he said.

29,2018-04-30,"Syria's Assad Presses Offensive, Missile Strikes Raise Escalation Risk",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/world/middleeast/30reuters-mideast-crisis-syria.html,987," By Reuters BEIRUT — The Syrian army unleashed a massive bombardment against one rebel enclave on Monday and prepared for the withdrawal of insurgents from another as President Bashar al-Assad pushes to crush the rebels' last besieged strongholds. However, missile strikes against several government military bases on Sunday - not claimed by any party despite speculation in Israel that its military was responsible - underscored the risks of a wider escalation in the seven-year conflict.  There were more than 140 Syrian army air strikes on the town of Rastan and surrounding villages in the rebel enclave between the cities of Hama and Homs early on Monday, alongside sustained shelling, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said.  Last week a Syrian government minister said the enclave would be the army's next target after it retook all rebel areas around the capital, a goal it looked closer to achieving with Monday's expected insurgent pullout from south Damascus. Later on Monday, Syrian state TV said the army would cease fire for 48-72 hours in the pocket between Homs and Hama - the most populous remaining encircled area in Syria - to allow rebel groups to agree a surrender deal under which they would leave for opposition-held areas in northern Syria. The ceasefire would be the last deadline before ""the military operation begins"", state TV said.  The Observatory said fighting had stopped there by late Monday afternoon.  ISRAEL? Despite Assad's ever-stronger position against rebels since Russia's entry into the war in 2015 brought a string of battlefield victories, the involvement of numerous regional and global powers threatens to inflame the war further. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the missile attacks that struck several bases near Hama and Aleppo overnight, causing large explosions, and the Syrian army blamed only ""aggression"" by its enemies. However, Israel has previously carried out strikes in Syria to stop Assad's ally Iran getting stronger there or transferring weapons to the Lebanese group Hezbollah, and there is widespread speculation in Israel that it was behind the attack.  Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz would not comment on the strikes, but added that Israel ""has made it unequivocally clear at all levels that it will not allow an Iranian front in Syria to be established"".  A spokesman for Israel's military said it would not comment on foreign reports. But Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, said Israel was likely behind the strikes.  ""Israel has to decide: 'Are we confronting Iran in Syria before they have full advanced weapons capabilities' ... or do we wait..., let them build a huge military capability in Syria and meet them in a future war and pay a very high price?""  Diplomats have warned of a possible major escalation between Israel and Iran in Syria as Assad and his allies take more territory from rebels.  The United States, Jordan and Assad's main ally Russia have declared a ceasefire zone in southwest Syria, near the border with Israel, and on Monday Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington's strategy there ""remains unchanged"".  The Observatory said at least 26 people - mostly Iranians and members of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia - were killed in Sunday's air strikes, and that dozens more people were missing.  Speaking in Israel on Sunday, Pompeo said the United States was ""deeply concerned about Iran's dangerous escalation of threats towards Israel and the region"" and said it was critical for the two allies to work together to stop it. The semi-official Iranian news agency Tasnim said no Iranian base had been hit or Iranians killed. Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a senior Iranian member of parliament, met Assad on Monday and said Tehran would keep military advisers in Syria until the war ended. Iran and its allies blamed Israel for an April 9 air strike on the Tiyas air base in Syria in which several Iranian military personnel were killed, and Iran has warned it would not go ""without response"".  ASSAULT The Syrian army's assault on the pocket between Homs and Hama included air strikes and artillery, according to the Britain-based Observatory.  Reinforcements arrived in government-held areas before the bombardment, which targeted Rastan, the biggest town in the pocket, and several nearby villages, the Observatory said.  Syrian rebels control large swathes of both northwest and southwest Syria. An alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the United States holds large parts of northern and eastern Syria after an offensive against Islamic State last year.  The pocket in southern Damascus is split between areas held by Islamic State and rebel groups. It has been the focus of a massive bombardment and intense fighting since the Syrian army recaptured eastern Ghouta earlier in April.  Late on Sunday, state media reported that rebel groups there had agreed to withdraw to opposition-held Idlib province in northwestern Syria. State media did not say which rebel groups were included, but a rebel source said the deal was with the jihadist Tahrir al-Sham alliance, which includes Syria's former al-Qaeda affiliate.  Another rebel confirmed media reports that Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters in another part of the enclave had also agreed to leave for northern Syria.  Footage on state television on Monday showed what it said was preparations for the withdrawal, along with the departure of buses in northern Syria to evacuate civilians from two government-held villages besieged by insurgents.  The surrender deal for Tahrir al-Sham in south Damascus was part of a deal to allow about 5,000 people to leave the two government-held Shi'ite villages, al-Foua and Kefraya, it said. The U.N. says around 8,100 people are besieged in al-Foua and Kefraya. However, SANA state news agency reported continued intensive bombardment of al-Hajar al-Aswad, another area in the south Damascus pocket where Islamic State militants are based.

30,2018-04-30,European Shares End April on a High as Sainsbury/Asda Merger Shakes Up Retail,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-europe-stocks.html,507," By Reuters LONDON — A multi-billion pound merger between British supermarket Sainsbury's and Asda shook up retail stocks on Monday while European benchmarks ended April with their strongest monthly gains since 2016.  The pan-European STOXX index rose 0.1 percent while Germany's DAX gained 0.3 percent, buoyed by investors' improved risk appetite as inter-Korea tensions eased and companies delivered strong earnings  The regional benchmark delivered a 3.8 percent gain in April, its strongest month since December 2016, after suffering losses in February and March - testament to renewed investor optimism after a volatility shock in February rattled markets. On the day, all eyes were on Sainsbury's, whose shares closed up 14.5 percent after it agreed to merge with Walmart's Asda to create Britain's biggest supermarket group by market share. The stock was on track for its best one-day gain ever. ""The merger, if successful, creates a retail giant in the UK with enough procurement and distribution scale to dominate food retail and challenge Amazon in non-food,"" said Berenberg analysts.  The said that Walmart's scale, the e-commerce capabilities of Sainsbury's Argos chain, and the potential synergies between food and non-food retail might be able to challenge Amazon's e-commerce dominance in the UK. Tesco, which would be overtaken as UK leader by the new merged group, fell 0.9 percent on the news. Morrisons slipped at the opening but finished 1.3 percent higher. The reaction among European retailers was mixed, too. France's Carrefour gained 0.9 percent and Casino rose 1 percent while Ahold Delhaize declined 0.4 percent. In other deal news, Deutsche Telekom shares ended the day down 0.7 percent, having earlier risen to the top of the DAX after the German firm clinched a $26 billion deal to merge T-Mobile US and Sprint. AccorHotels rose 1.9 percent after the French hotel chain agreed to buy rival Movenpick Hotels & Resorts for $567 million. In results-driven moves, the world's biggest advertising group, WPP, surged 8.6 percent after reporting forecast-beating sales in its first results without founder Martin Sorrell. The agency's gains boosted the pan-European media sector by 1.4 percent to a three-month high. A drag on the banking sector was Sweden's SEB, which tumbled 4.5 percent after reporting first-quarter profit below market expectations as cautious corporate customers and a seasonal slowdown hampered earnings. French construction materials firm Imerys also fell 5.2 percent after reporting results.  Glencore dropped 5 percent after mining subsidiaries in the Democratic Republic of Congo were served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion. Overall, Europe's first-quarter results season has kicked off relatively weakly, particularly compared to the first quarter of 2017. Earnings have surprised negatively, on average, in the banking sector, while commodity-related sectors have reported surprisingly strong results thanks to higher materials prices, according to Goldman Sachs. Societe Generale analysts struck a note of caution about investors' high expectations of earnings. ""Optimistic consensus earnings growth for the next three years could be a source of disappointment,"" they wrote in a note entitled ""Reality check"".

Earlier on Monday, Marathon said it would acquire rival Andeavor for more than $23 billion (17 billion pounds) to form a company that would leapfrog Valero Energy Corp as the largest U.S. refiner by capacity. Marathon's higher profit and its deal for Andeavor both come as U.S. refiners benefit from stronger demand thanks to U.S. shale output hitting record highs. U.S. refiners, which source heavy crude from Canada, have also benefited from cheaper oil from the region. Marathon's refining and marketing margins rose 1.3 percent to $1.81 billion in the three months ended March 31. Net income attributable to Marathon rose to $37 million or 8 cents per share, from $30 million or 6 cents per share a year earlier. The company, which also operates convenience store chain Speedway, said total revenue jumped 16 percent to $18.98 billion.

33,2018-04-30,"Trump Delays Metal Tariffs on Canada, EU, Mexico, Exempts Some Others",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-usa-trade-metals.html,848," By Reuters WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, the European Union and Mexico until June 1, and has reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil, the White House said on Monday. The decisions came just hours before temporary exemptions from the tariffs on these countries were set to expire at 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House said that the details of the deals with Brazil, Argentina and Australia would be finalized shortly, and it did not disclose terms. ""The administration is also extending negotiations with Canada, Mexico, and the European Union for a final 30 days. In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security,"" the White House added. A source familiar with the decision said that there would be no further extensions beyond June 1 to stave off tariffs. Trump on March 23 imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March, but granted temporary exemptions to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the EU, Australia and Argentina. He also has granted a permanent exemption on steel tariffs to South Korea. Trump has invoked a 1962 trade law to erect protections for U.S. steel and aluminum producers on national security grounds, amid a worldwide glut of both metals that is largely blamed on excess production in China. The tariffs, which have increased frictions with U.S. trading partners worldwide and have prompted several challenges before the World Trade Organization, are aimed at allowing the two U.S. metals industries to increase their capacity utilization rates above 80 percent for the first time in years. Trump administration officials have said that in lieu of tariffs, steel- and aluminum-exporting countries would have to agree to quotas designed to achieve similar protections for U.S. producers. EXEMPTION TERMS UNCLEAR Spokesmen for Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and the country’s Trade Minister Steven Ciobo both declined to comment when contacted by Reuters about the deal's terms before the White House's official announcement.  Shares in Bluescope Steel Ltd, Australia’s only steel producer, rose on reports of the agreement, trading 0.6 percent higher by 0320 GMT after opening lower. South Korea earned its permanent exemption from steel tariffs by agreeing to quotas that will cut its steel shipments by about 30 percent from 2017 levels. Seoul is still subject to U.S. aluminum tariffs. The White House said the agreements reflect administration efforts ""to reach fair outcomes with allies to protect our national security and address global challenges to the steel and aluminum industries.""  Todd Leebow, president of Majestic Steel USA, a Cleveland-based distributor of domestic steel products, said American steelmakers needed certainty that import protections won't be eroded. ""We're hopeful this extension moves us toward the most productive path for our domestic steel industry -- the tariffs President Trump announced earlier this year and a quota system to limit the amount of imports flooding our country,"" Leebow said in a statement. The metals tariffs have caused some divisions within Trump's Republican Party, as steel and aluminum consuming industries have warned that higher prices would hurt their competitiveness. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a pro-trade Republican from Texas, said he would work to ensure that the tariffs ""are narrow and targeted to protect our workers and job creators here at home.""  But Canada, Mexico and the European Union have all insisted that they will not accept quotas to gain permanent exemptions from the U.S. tariffs. A British government spokeswoman in Washington said the extension for the EU was ""positive,"" but the UK steel and aluminum industries needed safeguarding. ""We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets."" Negotiations over U.S. steel and aluminum tariff exemptions for Canada and Mexico have also become intertwined with intensified talks to reach an agreement to update the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canada is the largest steel exporter to the United States, and its industry is highly integrated with that of its southern neighbor, with raw materials and finished steel crisscrossing the Great Lakes region.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday that any move by the United States to impose tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would be a ""very bad idea"" guaranteed to disrupt trade between the two countries.  If the EU is subject to tariffs on the 6.4 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of the metals it exports annually to the United States, it has said it will set its own duties on 2.8 billion euros of U.S. exports of products ranging from makeup to motorcycles.

34,2018-04-30,Islamic State Ally Stakes Out Territory Around Lake Chad,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/world/africa/30reuters-nigeria-security.html,1305," By Reuters ABUJA/MAIDUGURI — From the shores of Lake Chad, Islamic State's West African ally is on a mission: winning over the local people. Digging wells, giving out seeds and fertilizer and providing safe pasture for herders are among the inducements offered by Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), which split from Nigeria's Boko Haram in 2016. ""If you are a herder, driver or trader, they won't touch you - just follow their rules and regulations governing the territory,"" said a herder, who moves cattle in and out of ISWA territory and whose identity Reuters is withholding for his safety. ""They don't touch civilians, just security personnel."" The campaign, which has created an economy for ISWA to tax, is part of the armed insurgent group's push to control territory in northeastern Nigeria and in Niger.  ISWA stretches farther and is more entrenched than officials have acknowledged, according to witnesses, people familiar with the insurgency, researchers and Western diplomats who have for the first time provided details of the group's growing efforts to establish a form of administration in the Lake Chad area. A map produced by the U.S. development agency in February and seen by Reuters shows how ISWA territory extends more than 100 miles into the northeastern Nigerian states of Borno and Yobe, where government has in many areas all but vanished after a decade of conflict.  The Islamists have not been defeated, as Nigeria says, and researchers say ISWA, less extreme than Boko Haram, has evolved into the dominant group. The U.S. map paints a similar picture, with ISWA operating in much of Borno.  ""Islamic State has a terrible reputation for being so brutal around the world, and people can't imagine an Islamic State faction could be more moderate (than Boko Haram),"" said Jacob Zenn, of The Jamestown Foundation in Washington D.C. The Lake Chad countries - Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon - have long neglected the region, allowing ISWA to create a stronghold from which to launch attacks. Its gains contrast with setbacks for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. It makes sense for ISWA to organize the local economy and raise taxes, said Vincent Foucher, who studies Boko Haram at the French National Centre for Science Research. ""It opens the longer game of trying to create a connection to people,"" he said, adding that if ISWA succeeds it may become a greater threat than Boko Haram. In 2015, Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to finish off Boko Haram. Officials maintain this has been achieved, although the conflict continues into its tenth year. A presidency spokesman declined to comment for this story. ""THEY ARE NOT A GOVERNMENT"" Analysts estimate that ISWA has 3,000-5,000 fighters, about double Boko Haram's strength. But ISWA's territory is not completely secure. The Nigerian air force often bombs, and troops from Lake Chad countries attack the insurgents' domain around its shores and islands. Nigeria's armed forces ""just see them as Boko Haram,"" said Brigadier General John Agim, spokesman for the Nigerian military, at a briefing. ""We are not interested in the faction, what has that got to do with it?"" ""They are not a government, they kidnap girls from schools,"" Agim told Reuters in a separate interview. The military has announced an operation ""to totally destroy Boko Haram locations in the Lake Chad Basin"" - ISWA's domain - and end the insurgency within four months. But ISWA has so far proven intractable in its Lake Chad bases, where troops have been unable to make effective inroads, according to a Western diplomat who follows the group. The Nigerian military had ""completely lost the initiative against the insurgency,"" they said. The diplomat said ISWA was ready to cede less important areas because the military cannot hold them. ""However, they maintain absolute control over the islands and immediate areas near them where they train, live, etc."" The U.S., British and French militaries are helping regional governments with intelligence and training. Western officials declined, or did not respond to, requests for comment. ISWA protects locals from Boko Haram, something Nigeria's army cannot always do. That, according to one of the people with knowledge of the insurgency, has won the group local backing and eroded support for the military. ISWA is led by Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the son of Boko Haram's founder, Muhammed Yusuf, whose killing by police in 2009 sparked an Islamist insurgency in Nigeria that, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, has so far cost more than 34,000 lives. ISWA's leaders are low-profile, not appearing in videos or claiming responsibility for attacks, possibly to avoid the international media, and the ire of regional governments. Reuters was unable to contact the group for comment. This contrasts with the wholesale violence of Boko Haram under the publicity-hungry Abubakar Shekau, who has executed even close lieutenants. His group has strapped suicide bombs to women and children to attack civilians in mosques, markets and refugee camps. SPIES EVERYWHERE Boko Haram and ISWA are bloody rivals, but some travelers in ISWA territory feel safer than elsewhere in Nigeria's northeast. ""They have checkpoints for stop and search, and if you are a regular visitor they know you,"" said a second herder, adding that ISWA has spies everywhere, including informers who alert them to military attacks. He described seeing Islamic State's black flags and said preachers were used to win people over. Under ISWA, men must wear long beards, night-time movements are restricted, and prayers are compulsory, the herder said. Offenders can get 40 lashes. The herders said ISWA provides safe grazing for about 2,500 naira ($8) a cow and 1,500 naira ($5) for smaller animals. ISWA also runs slaughterhouses for the cattle, taking a cut for each animal, as well as from other activities like gathering firewood. SUPPLY AND DEMAND Maiduguri is the biggest city in Nigeria's northeast, the center of the military's fight against Boko Haram. But rural areas largely remain no-go zones for the authorities. It is there that ISWA is making its mark, offering people protection, particularly from Boko Haram. ""Al-Barnawi is sending people into IDP (displaced persons) camps to encourage people to return and farm, and the people are,"" said a person with knowledge of ISWA's activities. The person said Nigeria's military plays into the insurgents' hands by shutting down markets to deny supplies to the group, while ISWA encourages business. ""They are friendly and nice to those who come to the area, while they indoctrinate other people and sometimes they bring motorcycles for those who want to join them,"" a charcoal maker said. DISTANT RELATIONS Despite its name, experts believe ISWA's ties to Islamic State in the Middle East are limited. ""What's clear from ISWA primary source documents is that ISWA has asked IS for theological guidance on who it is lawful to attack,"" said Zenn. Daily activities, including military operations, are left to its own leaders, he said. Others say the insurgency lacks the broader appeal of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""ISWA is the largest IS affiliate, but it's very much a Nigerian organization. It doesn't have foreign fighters coming, it's hard to get to this place,"" said the Western diplomat. What fighters it does have can carry out targeted attacks, including the February kidnapping of 100 schoolgirls from the town of Dapchi, most later released without explanation, and a deadly raid on a Nigerian military base in March. But ISWA faces a dilemma: while wooing the population, it has harshly punished those who resist it, for example massacring dozens of fishermen last August, and this could hurt its standing with local people. ""It's important not to paint too rosy a picture,"" said Foucher, the researcher.

35,2018-04-30,New Dawn or Swan Song? Czech Communists Eye Slice of Power After Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/world/europe/30reuters-czech-politics-communists.html,836," By Reuters PRAGUE — When the United States, Britain and France bombed Syria earlier this month, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis showed support for his Western partners one day before rowing back the next. The military strike turned from ""inevitable"" to an act described as changing nothing after Babis was rebuked by the far-left Communist party, showing the fine line the billionaire businessman is walking as he tries to form a government. Babis is aiming for a pro-Western administration but political fragmentation in October's election means he needs the pro-Russian Communist party to either support it or abstain, ending the party's pariah status since communism fell in 1989. The Communists and President Milos Zeman will push Babis -- whose ANO party is pro-EU and pro-NATO -- toward a softer tone on Moscow, but he is not expected to move far despite the fall of his first minority cabinet in a confidence vote in January. Shunned by most parties over charges of fraud in a 2 million euro EU subsidy case he says is a plot, Babis is now negotiating a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats that would also lean on Communist votes. The Communists' limited role, with no cabinet seats, would not bring the kind of changes to core policies that have sparked conflict between the EU and Hungary and Poland, but would still anger many Czechs who suffered under their rule. The current Communist rank and file, with average age well over 70, are nostalgic about life behind the Iron Curtain, and the party pledges to fight global capitalism and leave NATO. ""Security threats do not come from the east, security is under threat from those who commit aggressive attacks against sovereign countries in violation of international law as the United States, Britain and France have done in Syria,"" party leader Vojtech Filip said at a party congress on April 21. FOREIGN POLICY The Communists would like to end EU sanctions on Russia and follow Moscow's line on Ukraine: party officials have traveled to separatist-controlled Donbass and Crimea. They oppose Czech participation in military missions lacking UN approval -- which means any opposed by Russia as permanent UN Security Council member. The Czechs have hundreds of troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, a number Babis's cabinet aims to boost this year by several hundred. The Czechs also plan to help protect NATO airspace in the Baltic. ""We have an elevated sensitivity to any pressure for escalation of tensions toward the post-Soviet region, we would have to react very strongly to anything like that,"" Communist member of parliament Richard Dolejs told Reuters. The Communists also criticized Babis's government for handing a suspected Russian hacker in March to the United States, and for expelling Russian diplomats after the attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. FALLING SUPPORT It is unclear what concessions the Communists would secure from the two coalition parties, but their influence will be limited by their waning popularity. They scored their worst post-Communist election result, 7.8 percent, in October, bleeding half of their votes to the far-right and to Babis. ""They have become very pragmatic over the last two decades,"" said Lubomir Kopecek, political science professor at the Masaryk University. ""The request to leave NATO does not appear in the talks...A large part of the party's elite wants to experience some recognition at the end of their political careers."" A senior source from one of the negotiating parties said the Communists would be satisfied with positions in administration and state-owned firms. In foreign policy, the government could seek support elsewhere in parliament. Dolejs said the party wanted to have a say on issues such as social benefits. ""Tolerating the government will raise our legitimacy. We see a chance to show our voters...that we can get at least a bird in the hand."" MORE TROUBLE ELSEWHERE? Involving the Communists is not a sudden turnaround. They have been part of regional governments and former party members, who include Babis himself, have held prominent jobs. For the center-right, the party remains a no-go. ""Andrej Babis is fulfilling his dream at too high a cost,"" Petr Fiala, leader of the Civic Democrats, said in a post last week. But elsewhere views are finely balanced. A Median agency survey last month showed 45 percent of Czechs could accept a Communist-backed government, while another 41 percent reject it. Thousands protested in March after Zdenek Ondracek, a Communist lawmaker who had been in a police unit that beat up pro-democracy protesters in the 1980s, was elected to lead a police inspection oversight body. Babis withdrew his support and Ondracek resigned. Within the Social Democrats, there is more debate about the risks of joining Babis, due to his legal problems and visions of streamlining political decision-making, than the Communists. And Social Democrat leader Jan Hamacek said on Saturday he was more worried about the rising far-right, anti-Islam, anti-NATO and anti-EU party SPD, which won 10.6 percent of the vote.

36,2018-04-30,Explainer-Beancounting: The EU's 'Coffee-a-Day' New Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-eu-budget-explainer.html,638," By Reuters BRUSSELS — The European Commission will unveil proposals on Wednesday for the Union's next seven-year budget, starting in 2021. Worth over a trillion euros (dollars), the costs of EU membership played a role in Britain voting to quit the bloc. However, EU leaders insist that spending just about one percent of total income -- roughly equal to the cost of one cup of coffee a day for 440 million citizens -- brings benefits for security, stability and prosperity. Here are answers to key questions: DOES BREXIT MAKE A DIFFERENCE? Absolutely. Despite a large and much envied British rebate, the loss of the EU's second-ranked economy will leave a hole of at least 10 billion euros a year. Rich states such as the Netherlands and Sweden insist they do not want to pay another cent and demand that the budget shrink. They have, however, lost an important ally since Britain was a driving force behind previous cuts. Poorer countries which are net recipients of EU cash, such as Poland, have warned that they will not accept less from Brussels. WHAT IS THE BUDGET FOR? The 2014-20 budget or Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is 1.1 trillion euros or 155 billion a year and, when agreed in 2013 was worth 1.03 percent of the bloc's economic output. It represents 2.2 percent of public spending in the 28 EU states. Most goes on subsidising farmers, improving poorer regions and promoting cooperation across the bloc. About 39 percent goes on farm support, rural development and related areas and 34 percent on economic, social and regional cohesion. Lawmaking and administration costs about 10 billion euros a year, or 6 percent. WILL THAT CHANGE? Yes. Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger has promised to propose spending at least as great as at present despite Brexit -- at least 1.1 percent of the EU's Brexit-diminished output and possibly close to 1.2 percent -- he calls it ""1.1x percent"". EU leaders expect to put more cash into: - policing frontiers to control immigration -- one source told Reuters the Commission will propose quintupling spending on border guards to 25 billion euros over 2021-7;  - science and technology research and cooperation; - joint EU defence projects, especially on procurement. To make room for that, Oettinger has spoken of cuts of about six percent in spending on agricultural and regional support. SO THAT'S ALL SETTLED? Far from it. The last MFF negotiations went down to the wire, taking two and a half years of haggling. Member states and the European Parliament are set for tough talks, though there is an informal deadline of agreement in the middle of next year. Germany and France, the biggest paymasters putting in 19 and 17 percent of the budget respectively, are ready to plug some of the Brexit gap if the budget suits their new priorities. Paris, for example, wants to see some budget allocated to the 19-member euro zone as part of plans to bolster the EU single currency. With its traditionally strong farm lobby, France is also likely to defend farmers from pressure to cut back on EU subsidies. WHAT'S THE BIGGEST FIGHT? Aside from possible reforms to the farm budget, officials expect the biggest fight to be one that pits poor, ex-communist countries in the east against rich net contributors in the west over what Brussels sees are threats to democracy and the rule of law, notably in Poland and Hungary. Leaders there deny they are breaking EU laws and values to entrench their own power. EU officials have told Reuters their proposals include a dramatic novelty which will tie disbursement of EU funds that via national and regional governments to authorities' provision of functioning judicial systems capable of enforcing EU rules. Expect Poland and Hungary to lead a vocal push back.  (Reporting by Alastair Macdonald ; @macdonaldrtr; editing by David Stamp)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
37,2018-04-30,Exclusive: U.S. Treasury Meets Business Groups on Chinese Investment Bill-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-usa-china-regulation-exclusive.html,599," By Reuters WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury officials met with about 10 industry groups on Monday to discuss the latest draft of legislation that would tighten scrutiny of foreign investment in order to limit Chinese efforts to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology, four sources familiar with the meeting said. A senior Treasury official described the meeting as ""uniformly positive.""  ""We didn't negotiate text at the meeting so much as get everyone in the room to tell them where we are and the direction the bill would take,"" the senior official, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record, said. ""We had made a number of changes to provide clarity in the bill for industry, but at the same time, hold the line on national security."" The official said it remained to be seen how the House and Senate would ultimately craft the legislation, which would broaden the reach of the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Corporate America has taken a keen interest in the bill because it would give CFIUS the power to further restrict Chinese investment in U.S. companies. It could also potentially lead the Chinese to retaliate and restrict U.S. company access to the world's second-largest economy. Tightening the CFIUS process is one of several efforts supported by the Trump administration, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, to establish a more protectionist stance in an effort to tamp down Chinese imports while raising the regulatory bar on what deals get approved. Attendees include the most powerful U.S. business lobbying group, the Chamber of Commerce, a source familiar with the situation said. Supporters of re-writing the CFIUS rules are now hoping to attach the legislation to the National Defense Appropriations Act (NDAA), legislation that is passed annually to fund U.S. defense needs, two of the sources said. The NDAA has been voted into law for 55 consecutive years, and will likely pass even with the midterm elections on the horizon.  The vehicle for passage will be determined by members of Congress, the Treasury official said.  A draft of the bill to be discussed in the meeting, seen by Reuters, would eliminate a measure which some tech companies complained would force them to go to CFIUS to get approval for technology sales if they involved intellectual property licensing and support. The draft also spells out that an investment fund can be passive, and not subject to CFIUS oversight even if there are foreign investors, as long as investment decisions are made by Americans and the decision on hiring those Americans is also made by Americans. Investment funds had complained that under an older version of the bill they could be subject to CFIUS if they managed Chinese money and wanted to invest in certain companies with high end technology.  The draft also defines passive investment as ""direct or indirect,"" but strikes a measure that says passive investors may be subject to a CFIUS review if they have access to non-technical information. Any access to technical information would remain subject to CFIUS oversight. Treasury oversees CFIUS, whose remit is all foreign investments into the United States, including equity investments. Under pressure from tech companies and others, the bill has already undergone a number of changes to soften its approach. Negotiators in the administration, on Capitol Hill and working for the investment and high tech community are on their fourth version of a bill on CFIUS. The bill previously underwent at least one proposed revision that would seek to narrow its scope.

38,2018-04-30,A Population That Pollutes Itself Into Extinction (and It’s Not Us),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/science/microbes-ecological-suicide.html,927," Basics By Natalie Angier For “simple” single-celled organisms, microbes often can seem as civic-minded as an Amish barn-raising crew. They cooperate to mince unwieldy complex carbohydrates into bite-size pieces for all to enjoy. They share the artisanally crafted molecules needed to extract essential iron from their surroundings. They jointly construct a kind of slimy tarp, a biofilm, on a convenient surface like a pond rock or your teeth, under which the microbes then safely hide. Through teamwork and constant chemical communication, microorganisms shape the world on which we macro-organisms preen. Yet scientists have discovered that just as a big holiday sale can quickly crush the wisdom of a human crowd underfoot, so can a microbial village be infected with mass stupidity, to devastating effect. Jeff Gore, a biophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his colleagues Christoph Ratzke and Jonas Denk, report that when a sample of Paenibacillus sp., a soil bacteria, is fed a diet of glucose and nutrients in the laboratory and allowed to grow at will, the microbes end up polluting their local environment so quickly and completely that the entire population soon kills itself off. In essence, the researchers said, the microbes commit “ecological suicide.” The study was published in April in Nature Ecology and Evolution. “The effect is so dramatic,” Dr. Gore said. “You have an exponential growth of the population followed by exponential death.” Within 24 hours of the onset of the death spiral, he said, “no viable cells were left in the entire culture.” It’s not that the microbes had exhausted their resources: Food remained to feed on. But in gorging heedlessly on the glucose bounty, each bacterium had secreted a steady flow of acidic waste into the culture medium, until the ambient pH level had plunged lethally low. “It’s a strong pH change,” Dr. Gore said. “The cells don’t realize what they’re doing in time to stop doing it.” Nor was Paenibacillus the only microbe found capable of committing eco-suicide. Testing a series of bacterial strains isolated from soil, the researchers found that about a quarter of them, if given the chance, would alter the acidity of their surroundings to the point of mass extinction. In each case, the researchers showed they could block the die-offs by either adding a buffer to the medium to sop up the acid or by slowing the reckless pace of microbial growth through modest applications of antibiotics. “This is a very important discovery,” said Jo Handelsman, who studies microbial diversity at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she directs the Wisconsin Institute of Discovery. “I didn’t think bacteria were so self-destructive, but this is a very simple phenomenon. The pH changes, and the bugs all die. How did we miss it all these years?” By the standard dogma, she said, inhibitory processes would intervene before an entire bacterial population is wiped out, with at least a scattering of microbes going quiescent, forming spores or otherwise waiting out the catastrophe until prevailing conditions improved. The new research suggests that extinction is more easily set in motion than previously thought, and that once it gets started, the responsible parties may be helpless to make it stop. Dr. Gore emphasized that the study was not a recapitulation of how microbes behave in the wild. They looked at individual isolates of bacteria, monocultures pampered with an assured source of glucose and freed of the need to contend with other microbes. In the real world of, say, a forest floor, “soil is a tremendously complex environment, with high bacterial densities and diversity and competing interests at play,” he said. Some bacteria are acidifying their neighborhood, while others turn it alkaline and still others expel politely neutral waste. That diversity, Dr. Gore suggested, likely keeps microbial populations from annihilating themselves under ordinary circumstances. The paper nonetheless illustrates the perpetual struggle found at every stratum of the natural world and its human hyperprojection: between cooperation and selfishness, the tribe and the individual — between the creation of a public good, like a siderophore agent for scavenging iron, and a public hazard, like acid waste. Nature is at best a fickle conservationist, and many animals can prove quite destructive to their surroundings. Flocks of parrots can strip stands of fruiting trees of all their seeds, risking the long-term viability of the very food source on which the birds depend. Elephants are endangered in much of Africa, but in some South African reserves like Makilali they are merry marauders, yanking down trees and denuding all visible vegetation at a dizzying rate. “It’s no surprise,” said Simon Levin, a theoretical ecologist at Princeton University. “Organisms engage in actions that provide short-term benefits that ultimately can be damaging to the societies of which they are part.” And humans, well, where do we start? Digging up lead, forging it into water pipelines and adding it to cosmetics, paint, gasoline and other everyday goods before realizing that lead is toxic in tiny doses, especially to the brain. Dumping sewage into lakes and rivers and shoveling plastic waste into the ocean, where it swirls and accretes into a ghastly new continent. Burning ancient sources of carbon at a fever pitch and hoping somebody figures out what to do about our battered climate before Osaka and Miami disappear. Dr. Gore calls himself “an optimist” and points to positive trends in earth management: cheaper solar power, cleaner air and water in some places, tigers rebounding in others. “There are some bright spots,” he said. Still, humans are a monoculture, a single macrobial strain, with none but ourselves to keep the petri dish clean.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
39,2018-04-30,Icebergs Could Float to the Rescue of Cape Town Water Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/world/africa/30reuters-safrica-drought-iceberg.html,326," By Reuters JOHANNESBURG — Marine salvage experts are floating a plan to tug icebergs from Antarctica to South Africa's drought-hit Cape Town to help solve the region's worst water shortage in a century. Salvage master Nick Sloane told Reuters he was looking for government and private investors for a scheme to guide huge chunks of ice across the ocean, chop them into a slurry and melt them down into millions of liters of drinking water. ""We want to show that if there is no other source to solve the water crisis, we have another idea no one else has thought of yet,"" said Sloane, who led the refloating of the capsized Italian passenger liner Costa Concordia in 2014. South Africa has declared a national disaster over the drought that hit its southern and western regions after 2015 and 2016 turned into two of the driest years on record. Tough water restrictions are already in place and Cape Town authorities have warned that taps could run dry altogether as soon as next year if winter rains do not come to the rescue of the port city's 4 million residents. Cape Town-based Sloane said his team could wrap passing icebergs in fabric skirts to protect them and reduce evaporation. Large tankers could then guide the blocks into the Benguela Current that flows along the west coast of southern Africa. A milling machine would then cut into the ice, producing a slurry and forming a saucer structure that will speed up the natural process, he said. A single iceberg ""could produce about 150 million liters per day for about a year,"" around 30 percent of the city's needs, said Sloane, a director at the U.S. marine salvage firm Resolve Marine. He said he was planning to hold a conference later this month to try and sell the $130 million project to city officials and investors. The city council was not immediately available for comment.

41,2018-04-30,Planets Finally Align for Sainsbury&#8217;s to Land &#163;7.3 Billion Asda Deal,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-sainsbury-s-walmart-m-a-deal.html,576," By Reuters LONDON — Codenamed ""Project Solar"", Sainsbury's 7.3 billion-pound deal with rival British supermarket chain Asda is an alignment of planets years in the making. In order to keep it secret, Asda, owned by U.S. giant Walmart, was dubbed ""Mars"" and Sainsbury's ""Jupiter"" by the teams working on the takeover, a source with direct knowledge of the talks said. The coming together of the two was eventually sealed by a group of retailing executives who have been crossing orbits as both rivals and colleagues for decades.  Indeed, Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe and Roger Burnley, the CEO of Asda, have a shared history that will aid with the integration of the two cultures, Walmart International chief Judith McKenna said on Monday.  Coupe, 57, will lead the combined business, while Burnley, 51, will continue to run Asda, which will keep its brand. The two are friends and Burnley became Asda's chief executive in January knowing that a deal with Coupe was on the cards. ""Mike and Roger's ability to work together from a previous life is really helpful,"" McKenna, an Asda veteran who worked with Coupe at the supermarket group in the 1990s, said.  Coupe, who grew up in West Sussex and enjoys playing the guitar and cycling, was a graduate trainee at consumer goods giant Unilever who then moved to Tesco's marketing department before joining Asda in 1993. He became its trading director before departing in 2001, following Walmart's 6.7 billion pound takeover of the British supermarket company in 1999.  After 18 months running frozen food business Iceland, Coupe went to Sainsbury's, becoming its trading director in 2004 and succeeding Justin King as its CEO 10 years later. Meanwhile, Yorkshireman Burnley started as a graduate at DIY chain B&Q before joining Asda as its supply director in 1996, while Coupe was there, and then taking a key role in the Walmart integration. In 2002 he was poached by Matalan to become the discount retailer's supply chain director, before reuniting with Coupe at Sainsbury's four years later.  Burnley spent a decade at Sainsbury's, rising to become its retail and operations director and working closely with Coupe, only to return to Asda as its chief operating officer in 2016. Like Coupe, Burnley is a keen cyclist, and also enjoys sailing, snowboarding and running in his spare time. However, despite the friendship between the pair, the tie-up between Britain's second- and third-largest food retailers stems from talks that Coupe held with David Cheesewright, McKenna's predecessor who retired as CEO of the U.S. firm's overseas arm, Walmart International, in January.  ""We've been talking to each other for a while,"" Coupe said. ""It goes back to some conversations that Dave Cheesewright and I had quite a period of time ago, but things really got going this time last year.""   That was after rival supermarket giant Tesco agreed a 4 billion-pound takeover of wholesaler Booker in January 2017 in a bid to strengthen its grip on Britain's food retailing market.  If the acquisition of Asda is cleared by regulators, it is expected to result in Sainsbury's leapfrogging Tesco to become the UK's largest supermarket operator by market share. It is Coupe's second deal, following Sainsbury's 2016 purchase of Argos. As long-time brokers to the company, advisers from UBS and Morgan Stanley worked with Sainsbury's on the Asda deal as well as the earlier Argos acquisition. Walmart is being advised by Rothschild and Credit Suisse.   (Reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by Alexander Smith)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
42,2018-04-30,Roberto Mancini Is the Top Candidate for Vacant Italy Job,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/30/sports/soccer/ap-soc-italy-mancini.html,158," By The Associated Press ROME — Zenit Saint Petersburg manager Roberto Mancini is the top candidate to become Italy coach after Carlo Ancelotti reportedly turned down the job. Mancini tells RAI state radio, ""There has not been contact with the (Italian football) federation but, for a coach, the Italian national team would be a source of honor and prestige."" Italian media reported over the weekend that Ancelotti informed the federation he was no longer interested. Under-21 coach Luigi Di Biagio guided Italy on an interim basis in friendlies last month but the team has not had a full-time coach since November when Gian Piero Ventura was fired after the Azzurri failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. Mancini, a former Italy player, has coached Fiorentina, Lazio, Inter Milan, Manchester City, and Galatasaray to titles. Nantes coach Claudio Ranieri remains a secondary candidate. The Italian federation has said it will announce a coach by May 20.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
43,2018-04-30,Flames Shot Out of Grinder Before Wisconsin Plant Explosion,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/30/us/ap-us-plant-explosion-wisconsin.html,552," By The Associated Press MADISON, Wis. — A corn grinder began belching flames shortly before a deadly explosion tore through a southern Wisconsin mill last year, federal safety inspectors said Monday. The May 31 blast at the Didion Milling Co. plant in Cambria killed five workers, injured 14 others and reduced the facility to rubble. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said in November that an accumulation of highly combustible grain dust probably caused the explosion. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board is investigating the explosion as well with an eye toward improving safety measures for industries dealing with dust. Board investigators interviewed 10 of the survivors and released a report of their accounts during a news conference Monday in Madison. According to the compilation, mill workers said they started smelling smoke about 15 to 30 minutes before the blast. Employees were inspecting the corn grinder as a possible source of the smoke when an air filter flew off the device, resulting in corn dust filling the air. Three-to-four foot flames began shooting from the air intake line. A superintendent who isn't named in the report yelled for everyone to clear the room. He was about to sound an evacuation when the explosion occurred, the report said. A second explosion knocked him to the ground. ""You know, the building, as I was running, I was looking behind me and the whole building was just, there were fireballs and stuff,"" the superintendent told investigators. ""It just kept exploding. Just sounded like thunder, like constant thunder. And I saw concrete and stuff blast. I just, I thought I was the only one that made it. I thought the whole place was done, you know."" The report notes that a dust cloud that catches fire within a confined space will expand until the enclosure bursts, releasing a pressure wave capable of damaging buildings and causing severe injuries. A 2006 CSB study on dust fires identified 281 incidents between 1980 and 2005 that killed 119 workers and injured 718 others. Since 2006 the board has conducted five investigations into dust-related incidents that have killed 27 people and injured 61 others, including the Didion blast. Monday's report didn't offer any conclusions about the cause of the explosion. Board investigators plan to use computer modeling to identify the amount of dust in the mill and are still examining the grinder as well as interviewing plant workers, the report said. The CSB doesn't issue sanctions, instead focusing on how to improve industry safety. OSHA, however, has cited Didion for 19 safety violations related to the explosion and proposed nearly $2 million in fines. Didion is contesting the citations before an administrative law judge in Washington, D.C. Didion issued a statement Monday saying company officials were reviewing the CSB's report and have been cooperating with the board to determine the explosion's cause. Board Investigator Mary Beth Mulcahy, however, told reporters at the news conference that workers told investigators on Sunday evening that the company warned them not to speak with the CSB about the blast. Didion spokeswoman Aisha Bachlani said in an email that the company has encouraged all employees to cooperate with CSB and any other agencies investigating the explosion. She added that the company as organized multiple CSB interviews with employees and given investigators regular access to the site. ___    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
44,2018-04-30,Scientists Hope Bug Experiment Fattens Colorado River Fish,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/30/us/ap-us-colorado-river-bugs.html,661," By The Associated Press FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Any great fishing hole depends on the health and well-being of its bugs. In a key stretch of the Colorado River below a dam on the Arizona-Utah border, anglers have been pulling out long, skinny trout that don't give up much of a fight with a hook in their mouths. Turns out, they don't have enough to eat, scientists say. Researchers with the U.S. Geological Survey are hoping a monthslong experiment to release low, steady flows of water from Glen Canyon Dam will give the eggs that bugs lay just below the water's surface a better chance at survival. It starts this weekend. ""For whatever reason, downstream of Glen Canyon Dam really lacks diversity,"" said Scott VanderKooi, who oversees the U.S. Geological Survey's Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center in Flagstaff. Scientists are anticipating a 26 percent increase in black flies and midges by next summer, and the eventual return of bigger bugs seen in other stretches of the Colorado River that largely have disappeared from a prized fishery known as Lees Ferry. When insects thrive, so do fish, bats, birds and other predators, scientists say. Insects attach their eggs to hard surfaces like rocks, wood or cattails near the river's shore. Fluctuations in the water for hydropower create artificial tides that can expose the eggs and dry them out. If they're not back underwater within an hour, they die, said Jeff Muehlbauer, a research ecologist with the Geological Survey. The so-called bug flows are part of a larger plan approved in late 2016 to manage operations at Glen Canyon Dam, which holds back Lake Powell. The plan allows for high flows to push sand built up in Colorado River tributaries through the Grand Canyon as well as other experiments with the flow that could help non-native trout. ""It's an ongoing endeavor to understand first, what's the status of all these different resources — the fish, the sandbars, the cultural resources — and then making adjustments based on how the ecosystem is changing,"" John Hamill said, a volunteer with Trout Unlimited who helped work on the plan. The flows won't change the amount of water the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation must deliver to three states and Mexico. The lower water levels on the weekend would be offset by higher peak flows during the week, the agency said. Still, hydropower is expected to take a $335,000 hit. ""We're not wasting water or anything in the name of bugs,"" agency spokesman Chris Watt said. ""We're using the flows that we're required to send down the river. We're just fluctuating when they go to possibly assist the insects."" Scientists say they are hoping to see positive responses from Glen Canyon Dam to Lake Mead on the Arizona-Nevada border. Anglers typically fish a 16-mile stretch of the Colorado River below the dam, either in a walkup area or by taking a boat upstream closer to the dam. While they have caught fish that were hearty and longer than 14 inches, Hamill said the ""sorry condition"" of the fish at times has driven anglers elsewhere. ""That's been a challenge,"" he said. ""It hasn't been a very dependable fishery."" When Ted Kennedy started working for the Geological Survey in 2002, other scientists noted the curious lack of stoneflies, caddisflies or mayflies throughout the Grand Canyon and the low numbers of other bugs. He began studying the larvae stages of bugs, then asked river guides and students for help studying the adult stages. Since 2012, the volunteers have set out plastic containers with a battery-powered black light for an hour each night, luring bugs and tracking the conditions. They deliver bottles of bugs to Geological Survey scientists. What they found is that fish have an unstable food source. That means they are longer, skinnier, can't swim well and don't have the energy to reproduce or fight. ""When things are bad for midges, there's not much else to take its place,"" said Kennedy, a research ecologist.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
45,2018-04-30,"Insurer Beazley to Launch Blockchain Registry With Bitfury, Lloyd's Broker",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/business/30reuters-usa-insurance-blockchain.html,389," By Reuters (Reuters) - Insurer Beazley has partnered with three companies to build a blockchain-based registry that will manage insurance for crisis situations such as mass shootings, the companies told Reuters. The registry will use blockchain to speed a response to mass casualties and their financial aftermath by allowing policyholders and insurers to catalogue coverage and share real-time information about threats and claims through one source, the companies said. The registry is created with Risk Cooperative, a Washington, D.C.-based speciality insurance broker that develops Lloyd's of London-backed programs, and Amsterdam-based Bitfury Group, a blockchain technology firm, and it is nearing completion, said Risk Cooperative Chief Executive Officer Dante Disparte in an interview. A fourth company, Emercoin, is providing blockchain infrastructure for the registry. Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, is the technology underpinning the first digital currency, bitcoin. But it can also be harnessed to track, record and transfer assets across all industries. The registry is an early example of using blockchain for insurance. Many insurance industry leaders envision ""smart"" policies of all types will be stored in blockchain and automatically track premiums, pay claims and keep records. Many companies still manually record on spreadsheets their annual policies and coverage limits, a practice that can heighten the risk of human error.  Violent events that spur mass casualties, such as an Oct. 1 mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people at a country music festival and injured hundreds more, can involve numerous insurance policy holders and thousands of claims. Policy exclusions or having too little coverage can leave communities and victims unable to cover expenses, but those gaps are easier to spot through a permanent blockchain ledger, Disparte said.  The partner companies are next planning to develop so-called ""smart"" policies for violent acts, to be permanently stored in the registry. They will be programmed to automatically kick in when a mass casualty occurs, eliminating claims paperwork for policyholders and trimming months from the settlement process, they said. Service providers, such as security experts and counselors, would be automatically be dispatched when an event is under way. The companies plan to store other types of existing policies for customers who buy mass casualty coverage, Disparte said. The registry will also eliminate time-consuming audits by underwriters because transactions will be recorded in one place.

46,2018-04-30,Canada Wants U.S. Cooperation in Turning Back Asylum Seekers,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/world/americas/30reuters-canada-immigration-border.html,487," By Reuters TORONTO — Canada wants to change a bilateral agreement to allow it to turn back thousands of asylum seekers walking across the border but the United States is not cooperating, according to a Canadian official with knowledge of the discussions. Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, or STCA, asylum seekers who arrive at a formal Canada-U.S. border crossing going in either direction are turned back and told to apply for asylum in the first country they arrived in.  Canada wants the agreement rewritten to apply to the entire border. More than 26,000 people have illegally crossed the Canada-U.S. border to file refugee claims in the past 15 months, walking over ditches and on empty roads along the world's longest undefended border. Many have told Reuters they might have stayed in the United States were it not for President Donald Trump's immigration rhetoric and policies. Canadian officials first discussed changing the pact with U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials last September, shortly after more than 5,700 asylum seekers walked into Canada in August. ""We'd like to be able to get them to agree that we can, if somebody comes across, we just send them back,"" the official told Reuters on Friday, adding Canada had raised the issue ""at least a dozen"" times since.  ""I wouldn't say they’ve been objecting or saying: 'No, we won't do it,' but it's been not responding rapidly."" The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing Canada's proposal and has not yet made a decision, a spokeswoman said. The Canadian official compared Canada's position to U.S. requests that Mexico prevent migrants traversing its territory from entering the United States ""We've got a problem, here. We've got to fix it,"" the official added. ""And we need the Americans' cooperation."" For now, another official said, Canada would keep doing what it is doing: Managing the influx of refugee claimants in a strained system, while seeking to dissuade would-be crossers through outreach efforts. Even if the United States agreed to take back anyone trying to cross into Canada, keeping people out between all ports of entry would be a challenge and could result in asylum seekers taking potentially deadly risks to avoid detection, said University of Toronto law and human rights professor Audrey Macklin.  The STCA already faces a Canadian court challenge that argues the agreement is discriminatory and violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Canada has also urged U.S. officials to crack down on visas, saying many of the asylum seekers had valid U.S. visas and used the United States merely as a transit point. Earlier this year, Canadian officials traveled to Nigeria, the source of a significant number of asylum seekers, to speak with Nigerian government officials and U.S. embassy staff. The number of U.S. visas being issued to Nigerians has since dropped, said Mathieu Genest, a spokesman for Canadian Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen.

47,2018-04-30,U.S. Lawmakers Seek Details From EPA Chief on Fuel Economy Rule Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/04/30/us/politics/30reuters-usa-epa-autos.html,423," By Reuters WASHINGTON — Two Democratic lawmakers asked Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt on Monday for documents related to proposed changes to vehicle fuel emission standards and California's authority to set its own measures, and accused him of misleading Congress of the agency's plans. U.S. Representatives Doris Matsui of California and Paul Tonko of New York sent the letter after reports on Friday that the EPA and National Highway Transportation Safety Administration had prepared a proposal that would likely freeze fuel economy standards from 2020 through 2026 and assert that a 1975 federal law pre-empts states from imposing their own emissions rules. Matsui said the reports, which came a day after Pruitt testified about ethics and travel concerns before two House committees, contradicted his response to her question about whether the EPA would revoke California's Clean Air Act waiver that enables it to set more stringent fuel economy standards. He said: ""Not at present."" ""If true, these reports directly contradict your testimony last week. As you were reminded at the start of that hearing, it is a violation of the law to knowingly make false statements to a Congressional committee,"" the letter said. The lawmakers requested all emails related to the development of the proposal, drafts, a list of staff that participated in the proposal and a list of all meetings held with industry and stakeholders about it.  They also asked for data used by the EPA earlier this month when it determined earlier proposed standards were too stringent.   ""The Agency is continuing to work with NHTSA to develop a joint proposed rule and is looking forward to the interagency process,"" EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said.  Bowman said the proposal had not yet been sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review. An administration source familiar with the proposal said it would be sent to the OMB by the end of the week. Other California lawmakers raised concerns about reports that the EPA could undermine California's waiver. “Like many Californians from across the political spectrum, I support our state’s long-standing waiver and I have shared my views with Administrator Pruitt on many occasions,"" said Republican Representative Ken Calvert, who said he would ""facilitate"" a discussion between the EPA and California officials in the coming days and weeks. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said his office was monitoring the EPA's plans. ""I'm ready to take any and all action necessary to defend our progress,"" the Democratic official said.

U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan said Alibaba did not show he had jurisdiction, having failed to establish a ""reasonable probability"" that Alibabacoin's interactive websites were used to transact business with customers in New York. The judge said it did not matter that Alibabacoin might eventually list its cryptocurrency on U.S. exchanges or that a New York company hosted one of its websites. He also said any injury Alibaba might have suffered to its business, goodwill and reputation from alleged trademark infringement likely occurred in China, where the e-commerce retailer is based. The Chinese company had alleged Alibabacoin hurt its business in the United States, causing actual confusion among customers there, in violation of federal and state laws.  A U.S.-based lawyer for Alibaba declined to comment. Lawyers for Alibabacoin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Oetken dissolved a temporary restraining order issued on April 2 by another judge against Alibabacoin. He also said Alibaba deserved another chance to show why the case belongs in Manhattan. Alibabacoin, which is also known as ABBC Foundation, has argued that it was not trying to piggyback off the Alibaba name. It has also said China's ban on initial coin offerings in September eliminated a key source of potential confusion among consumers about its lack of ties to Alibaba. The case is Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd v. Alibabacoin Foundation et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-02897.

49,2018-05-01,"White House Delays Tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico for 30 Days",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/white-house-delays-tariffs-eu-canada-mexico.html,1291," By Ana Swanson WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Monday that it would delay a decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs on the European Union, Canada and Mexico for another 30 days, giving key allies a reprieve as the White House tries to extract concessions from trading partners who have resisted those demands. The extension reflects concerns by the Trump administration of a swift retaliation on American products by European Union nations, and will also give the Trump administration more breathing room to work on a separate trade battle with China. The 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum were set to go into effect on Tuesday and had set off a global scramble by nations trying to secure permanent exemptions. The administration, which granted temporary exemptions to a handful of countries in March, said it had reached initial agreements with Argentina, Australia and Brazil that would allow them to avoid the tariffs, at least for now. Details of those agreements will be finalized in the next 30 days, the White House said. President Trump’s decision puts off a move that could have enraged key American allies at a delicate moment, as the United States heads toward tricky negotiations with North Korea and is considering abandoning the Iran nuclear deal over the objections of European Union leaders. Despite the president’s tough stance on trade, many of his advisers are leery of initiating trade clashes that could destabilize stock markets and put other political goals at risk, like updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House is also dispatching a delegation of top officials to Beijing this week to try to soothe tensions in its trade battle there. The Trump administration had been trying to pressure Europe, Canada, Mexico and other nations to renegotiate trading terms in America’s favor, including limiting the flow of foreign metals into the United States, saying that it would grant exclusions to the tariffs for countries that agreed to meet its demands. But while the threat of tariffs had helped finalize a continuing deal with South Korea, there has been little indication that other nations will bend. The reprieve will come as a relief to major American allies that were bracing for damage to their economy from lower sales of metals into the United States. But it could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations. In recent weeks, American negotiators have pressed allies to restrain their own metal shipments to the United States voluntarily in exchange for having the tariffs lifted. “In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment and protect the national security,” the White House said in its statement Monday evening. But officials have also embarked on unrelated trade discussions. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been charged with negotiating with the European Union, had been pushing for the bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported cars and lower its trade surplus with the United States. Foreign allies and companies that source steel and aluminum from abroad were left in suspense about how the tariffs deadline would play out until late Monday and were fretting about the uncertainty created by the situation. So far, European officials have held firm to their insistence that the trade measures violate international trading law. The temporary extension is unlikely to satisfy the European Union, whose leaders have said they do not want to negotiate under threat and have demanded a permanent and unconditional exemption from the tariffs. If the tariffs do go into effect after the 30-day reprieve, Europe has promised swift retaliation. It has drawn up a lengthy list of American products it would penalize in return, including orange juice, cranberries, motorcycles and bluejeans. It has also asked to join a dispute China brought at the World Trade Organization against the steel and aluminum tariffs. “The U.S. decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions,” the European Union said in a statement on Tuesday. “The E.U. should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.” In a statement, the British government said the move was “positive,” while the Australian government said that it “will ensure our trade relationship continues to grow in a fair and reciprocal manner.” An extension of the tariff deadline was more widely expected for Canada and Mexico, which are still in negotiations with the United States over Nafta. Although differences of opinion remain, officials from the countries insist they are making quick progress toward a goal of concluding their talks by the end of May. Canada and Mexico have said that putting tariffs in place in the middle of these discussions could upend delicate negotiations. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said he was “optimistic” that his country would secure an exemption, arguing that the Trump administration understood that tariffs on Canada would hurt jobs on both sides of the shared border. The administration has also been in talks with Japan, the largest American ally to be left off the initial list of countries that were granted a temporary exemption from the tariffs — in part because of the country’s trade patterns, including a large surplus with the United States, but also because the Trump administration hoped to urge the country into one-on-one trade talks. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan dashed those plans after visiting the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in mid-April. Mr. Abe insisted that talks take the form of the United States rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Mr. Trump withdrew from. Mr. Trump derided the deal, writing on Twitter that it had “too many contingencies.” The monthlong reprieve prolongs the state of uncertainty hanging over the global economy, making it difficult for businesses to plan and discouraging them from investing in new factories or hiring more workers. That unpredictability has plagued even steel and aluminum companies that support the measure. Todd Leebow, the president and chief executive of Majestic Steel USA, which buys and sells American-made steel, said the tariffs were already helping to revive the American industry. Still, he noted that his customers did not know where they would be able to purchase metals from, and where prices might head. “From an industry perspective, the challenge that we have is it creates uncertainty,” Mr. Leebow said. But some said the measures are helping accomplish one of the administration’s major goals: combating an overcapacity of metals from China. The European Union and Canada, among others, have introduced steeper measures in recent months to crack down on cheap flows of steel into their markets, and to stop China from shipping steel through their countries to the United States. “There’s some evidence that the approach is working,” said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supports the metal restrictions. He said that temporary exemptions did not worry him, but that they should not be left in place indefinitely or unconditionally. Other nations affected by the tariffs have not been so optimistic. In Europe, the tariffs have driven down steel prices, as countries that did not receive exemptions, like Russia, Turkey and India, redirect their shipments from the United States. The flood of imports has hit the European steel industry just as it is bouncing back from a crisis that began five years ago and was caused by steel sold at dumping prices by Chinese producers. “They are worried that another wave of imports could throw the industry back into crisis mode,” Martin Theuringer, the managing director of the German Steel Federation, an industry group, said of European steel makers.

51,2018-05-01,"$50,000 Payment Adds Intrigue in Greitens' Legal Case",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/01/us/ap-us-missouri-governor.html,789," By The Associated Press ST. LOUIS — Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens' attorneys have suggested a ""political operative"" was behind the release to the media of a recorded conversation between a woman and her then-husband in which she graphically describes her affair with the future governor. Now the defense believes a new revelation in the criminal case that spun out of that affair offers fuel for the contention. In a court session Monday in the Republican governor's felony invasion of privacy case, Greitens' attorney Jim Martin said political newspaper publisher, talk show host and well-connected conservative Scott Faughn was the person who delivered the first of two $50,000 payments in January to Al Watkins, the suburban St. Louis attorney for the ex-husband of the woman involved in the affair. Faughn is a longtime critic of Greitens, who won election as a political outsider in 2016, and Faughn has faced his own legal troubles. The ex-husband is a pivotal player because it was his secretly recorded conversation in which the woman with whom Greitens had an affair said Greitens blindfolded her and took a compromising photo of her without her permission in March 2015, before he was elected. That allegation led a grand jury to indict Greitens in February. He goes to trial May 14. Watkins disclosed Faughn's name during a deposition, Martin said in court. Watkins declined comment. It remains unclear whether the $50,000 belonged to Faughn or someone else. That payment and a second mysterious $50,000 that Watkins has said was delivered by courier and was used to cover the ex-husband's legal expenses are among the many issues Greitens' attorneys have seized upon. They've also accused the chief investigator of lying in court and questioned the honesty of the woman, whose name authorities have not released. The governor has called the allegations a ""political witch hunt."" Several lawmakers called for Greitens to resign based on the criminal case as well as the woman's testimony to a special House committee in which she said Greitens had restrained, spanked, slapped, shoved, threatened and belittled her during a series of sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid. He also is accused of wrongly using a donor list from a veterans charity he founded to raise money for his political campaign. Martin told Circuit Judge Rex Burlison that Faughn is connected to a group angry about losing tax credits. He didn't elaborate, but in November, Greitens and other members of the Missouri Housing Development Commission voted against giving out $140 million in state low-income housing tax credits to subsidize places to live in poor areas of the state. Faughn is owner of the Missouri Times, a newspaper he co-founded in 2013 that focuses on state government. He also operates ""This Week in Missouri Politics,"" which airs in several Missouri television markets. Faughn did not respond to interview requests. In an online video Monday, he didn't directly address the $50,000 payment. He said he retained Watkins in connection with research for a book about the 2016 election. Faughn said he had obtained the ex-husband's audio before the affair became public and planned to use it as source material for the book. He said he never had a conversation with the ex-husband and never provided the audio to anyone else. Watkins has said he received the two payments shortly before the affair became public on Jan. 10, when KMOV-TV in St. Louis aired the recording. Faughn, 38, has been involved in politics since a young age. He became mayor of Poplar Bluff, a southeast Missouri town of about 17,000, at the age of 22 in 2002. He then led the Poplar Bluff Chamber of Commerce and was a catalyst behind a successful effort to widen a local highway. But he was convicted in 2007 of three felony counts for forging checks from an account related to that effort and was fined $1,500. Republican state Rep. Kathie Conway, a friend of Faughn, said he never spoke to her about any payment to Watkins' firm. ""Jefferson City is a small town, it really is,"" Conway said. ""You almost find everybody connected to somebody else in some way, shape or form. But is this politically motivated? I don't know."" Democratic House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty of Kansas City said the real question is who is funding Greitens' legal defense. Supporters of the governor in March established a nonprofit to cover his legal expenses. McCann declined to speculate on how Faughn's payment could impact the criminal case, but said the legislative investigation is unaffected. ""I think it's meant to be a distraction, but as far as our House investigation goes, we will continue to take testimony and move forward,"" McCann Beatty said. ""We have an obligation to do that.""    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
52,2018-05-01,2 Koreas Dismantle Propaganda Loudspeakers at Tense Border,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/01/world/asia/ap-as-koreas-tensions-.html,902," By The Associated Press SEOUL, South Korea — The rival Koreas dismantled huge loudspeakers used to blare Cold War-style propaganda across their tense border on Tuesday, as South Korea's president asked the United Nations to observe the North's planned closing of its nuclear test site. The dismantling of dozens of loudspeakers was in line with an agreement on reconciliation by the leaders of the Koreas at their historic summit last Friday. It is still unclear if such measures can bring permanent peace because no major breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear standoff was produced at the summit. South Korean soldiers disassembled loudspeakers in multiple front-line areas in the presence of journalists before pulling them away from the border, the Defense Ministry said. A South Korea military officer said later Tuesday that North Korea had also begun taking down its propaganda loudspeakers earlier in the day. He requested anonymity, citing department rules. Both Koreas had turned off the propaganda broadcasts along the 248-kilometer (154-mile) -long border last week before the summit. They had restarted their propaganda warfare in early 2016 when tensions rose sharply after North Korea's fourth nuclear test. South Korea broadcast K-pop songs as well as criticism of the North's abysmal human rights conditions, world news and weather forecasts. The North broadcast anti-South messages and praises of its own political system. North Korea is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its system, and most of its 24 million people are not allowed access to foreign TV and radio programs. In 2014, North Korean soldiers opened fire after South Korean activists sent anti-North leaflets over the border with large balloons, prompting South Korea to return fire. There were no reports of casualties. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has suspended nuclear and missile tests and placed his nuclear program up for negotiation, but skepticism lingers about how serious his offer is and what disarmament steps he would eventually take. Some experts say Kim's sincerity will be tested during his planned meeting in several weeks with U.S. President Donald Trump, in what would be the first North Korea-U.S. summit talks since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Trump said Monday he likes the idea of going to the southern side of Panmunjom, the location of the Korean summit, to meet Kim, though he said Singapore was also under consideration. Ahead of that meeting, the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China are to meet next Wednesday in Tokyo for a regular trilateral summit that is expected to focus on North Korea's nuclear program and other regional issues. During their meeting last Friday, Kim told South Korean President Moon Jae-in that he would shut down his country's only known nuclear test site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process. He also said he would be willing to give up his nuclear programs if the United States commits to a formal end to the Korean War and pledges not to attack the North, according to South Korea's presidential office. During a telephone call with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday, Moon said he wants the U.N. to observe the closure of the Punggy-ri test site. Moon also asked the U.N. to formally declare its support for his summit declaration with Kim. Guterres responded that he will try to contribute to the establishment of peace on the Korean Peninsula, according to Moon's office. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said late Tuesday that Moon asked Guterres for U.N. support ""to verify the imminent closure"" of North Korea's nuclear test site. He said the South Korean leader also asked the secretary-general for U.N. support in implementing the agreement by Moon and Kim ""to transform the demilitarized zone into a peace zone."" Dujarric said ""the secretary-general reiterated the full support of the United Nations to furthering the inter-Korean dialogue and in this regard pledged that the United Nations stands ready to discuss possible forms of support."" Some experts downplayed the closure of the Punggy-ri site, saying the six underground nuclear explosions that have been conducted there may have made it too unstable for more testing. Kim denied such views, saying the site has two additional underground tunnels that could be used for new tests. A major source of outside suspicion about Kim's sincerity is his use of the term, ""the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"" instead of ""the denuclearization of North Korea."" North Korea has long used the first term, and has argued it can disarm only when the United States withdraws its 28,500 troops from South Korea and removes its so-called ""nuclear umbrella"" security commitment to South Korea and Japan. A joint summit statement issued by Kim and Moon said they will work together to achieve ""a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula through complete denuclearization."" It was the first time that Kim has proposed negotiating away his nuclear weapons, and some analysts say he could reveal more substantial disarmament measures in his meeting with Trump, including the possible scrapping of his long-range missile program that has posed a direct threat to the United States. Prospects for the Kim-Trump talks remain unclear because Kim prefers a gradual, step-by-step disarmament process in return for corresponding rewards, while the United States wants complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. On Monday, Moon shook off a suggestion that he receive the Nobel Peace Prize for reducing tensions with North Korea, saying Trump ""can take the Nobel prize"" as long as the Koreas receive peace in return.

53,2018-05-01,Celebrate Spring With an Upscale Smothered-Chicken Dinner,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/magazine/spring-smothered-chicken-dinner.html,739," Eat By Sam Sifton Chefs are not generally the best source for recipes. They don’t use them the way we do at home. Often they don’t use recipes at all. Many of them cook instinctively, the way artists work. They do not measure ingredients before cooking. They navigate by taste and smell. They respond to the sound of fat sizzling against a piece of fish, or the sight of a shallot turning golden in the heat. When they’re happy with the food, they jot down a few notes, then cook the dish again and again until it can be made by rote. The people who work for them watch and listen and smell and taste until they can do the same — professional cooking is about apprenticeship and technique. Most line cooks don’t receive formal recipes from which to cook. They get battlefield instruction for soldiers new to the front, sauce-stained cards scribbled with notes: sweat in rondeau, drop; roast, save fond; arroser fish; crash jus with stock. Civilians don’t cook that way. So when I got it into my head to cook a version of the pan-roasted chicken with morels and a Madeira-laced cream sauce that the chef Angie Mar has on her spring menu at the Beatrice Inn in Manhattan — it’s an upscale smothered-chicken dinner, basically — I didn’t ask for the recipe. I asked if I could watch her cook. Mar was game. “I never really write recipes anyway,” she said. “It’s hard.” (Lately, to get better at it, she said, she has been weighing all her ingredients before cooking, and then weighing what’s left when she’s done, to arrive at exact measurements if not the time spent preparing them.) She invited me to the restaurant on a Monday, when it was closed, the cooks off for the day. There were a couple of plumbers wedged under the bar up front, fixing a pipe. Mar was wearing black, and among her necklaces there was a golden one with a rectangular pendant. It read: “In Pursuit of Magic.” I thought that was a good sign. In the restaurant’s cramped and tiny kitchen, she assembled ingredients: pint deli containers of savory and tarragon and parsley, of Oregon morels, Cognac and Madeira, crème fraîche, chicken stock, cream. There was a slim, beautiful heritage-breed chicken resting on a platter. “This is going to be luxurious,” she said. It was heaven, and instructive, to watch Mar work that morning: to see how she cut up the chicken into bone-in thighs and legs, wings and boneless breasts; how she browned them slowly, piece by piece in a low Dutch oven, so that the skin became golden and tight; how she tossed the morels in the fat of the chicken and flamed them with the Cognac; and how she simmered them with the chicken and a little stock so that, amazingly, both legs and breasts were moist and perfect. She worked slowly and methodically, perhaps because I was perched at her shoulder stopwatching and taking notes, but also as a home cook might, step by step. She was finished in under an hour. Mar talked as she worked, noting how the cream was thickening in the sauce, how she was going to add the Madeira in parts, so she could taste her way to the flavor she wanted. At one point I saw her slip a knob of butter into the cream on the stove, to follow the wine. She saw me notice and laughed. “For gloss,” she said. More followed with the crème fraîche, so that the sauce fairly glistened, like silk cloaking the back of a spoon. “To me, this dish is like a celebration of the very start of spring,” Mar said. She grew up in Seattle and looks forward to the yearly arrival of Washington State morels with joy. She loves how they sop up the nutty caramel flavor of the Madeira in the cream, how well they play alongside the fresh, crisp softness of the chicken. The dish tastes of France and the Pacific Northwest and maybe a little bit of Canada too, with the savory. It tastes of New York, in other words, where extravagance for dinner is often just a matter of shopping well and following a recipe closely. If you have a recipe, that is. I took my notes home and wrote one up. It worked like an incantation, magic every time. Recipe: Pan-Roasted Chicken in Cream Sauce cooking    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
54,2018-05-01,Permira to Buy Back Cisco's Pay-TV Software Business,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-cisco-systems-divestiture-permira.html,397," By Reuters TEL AVIV — Private equity firm Permira said on Tuesday it is buying back Cisco System's video software unit, six years after it sold the business to Cisco for $5 billion (3.6 billion pounds). Permira said a subsidiary had agreed to buy the UK-based unit, which it will turn into a new, rebranded company focused on developing video software for the pay-TV industry. It named video industry veteran Abe Peled as chairman of the business. A source familiar with the deal said Permira was paying $1 billion for the unit, confirming a report in Israeli news website Calcalist. Peled declined to comment on the price tag. Peled, who has been advising Permira for the past six years, was CEO of the business, then called NDS, when it was sold by Permira and News Corp to Cisco in 2012. The company's customers include Sky TV in the UK, AT&T's DirecTV, Vodafone in Germany and China's state satellite TV. However, it is operating in a highly competitive environment as companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc's prime video have all been investing heavily to strengthen content. NDS, established in 1988 in Israel, is now based in the UK and has about 3,500 employees, including about 700 at its research and development centre in Israel. Peled told Reuters by phone that the business is profitable but would not disclose details. The transaction fits in well with Permira's strategy, he said, noting the private equity firm has multiple investments in pay-TV and technology. ""They see opportunity for creating value through innovation and growth,"" Peled said. Streaming piracy is another problem for the industry and Peled noted that Israel's expertise in cybersecurity could help the company further develop solutions. Peled said more than 50 percent of major pay-TV operators in the world are customers of the video software unit, with its software installed in over 300 million end-user devices. Cisco senior vice president Yvette Kanouff said in a blog that Cisco's strategy is focused on areas such as networking, cloud, security and data. Peled could not say what exit strategy Permira will choose for the business. ""You focus on the company doing well and creating value and when the time comes the exit strategy will present itself, whether it's an IPO or another private equity firm or a strategic acquisition,"" he said.

55,2018-05-01,London Stock Exchange to Suspend EN+ GDRs Due to U.S. Sanctions,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-usa-russia-sanctions-en-group.html,217," By Reuters LONDON — The London Stock Exchange on Tuesday said it would suspend trading in the global depositary receipts (GDRs) of Russian aluminium and power producer En+ due to U.S. sanctions. The LSE said the GDRs, which allow the company to trade alongside domestic stocks, would be halted at 1615 GMT on Wednesday.  ""The exchange will continue to monitor the situation and is in communication with the UK authorities,"" the LSE said in a notice on its website.  The London-listed GDRs sank 54 percent in two sessions after the United States on April 6 imposed new sanctions on Russian entities including En+ and aluminium magnate Oleg Deripaska. En+ owns a stake in Russian aluminium producer Rusal, a major target of the sanctions. Reuters data showed En+ GDRs last traded on April 9.  According to one source, holders of the GDRs have not been able to sell because designated clearing house Euroclear is not settling the trades. In its annual results on April 30, En+ said Deripaska held 66.08 percent of the company through two holding companies as of Dec 31. En+ said in a statement on Friday that Deripaska had agreed in principle to reduce his stake in En+ to less than 50 percent.

56,2018-05-01,"U.S. Factory Activity Slows Further, Tariff Concerns Grow",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-usa-economy-construction.html,777," By Reuters WASHINGTON — U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April, with manufacturers complaining about rising commodity prices in the wake of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Tuesday also showed shortages of skilled workers, which together with the proposed import tariffs were causing bottlenecks in the supply chain.  Rising raw material costs are the latest indication that inflation pressures are building and could attract the attention of Federal Reserve officials who began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Data on Monday showed a jump in annual inflation rates in March. In addition, wages grew at their quickest pace in 11 years in the first quarter. ""It supports our view that the Fed will raise interest rates three additional times this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is underestimating the amount of developing inflation pressures."" The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The Fed increased borrowings costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. The ISM said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.3 last month from 59.3 in March. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The survey's prices paid index increased 1.2 points to 79.3, the highest reading since April 2011. Last month, price increases occurred across 17 of 18 industry sectors. Machinery manufacturers said tariffs had increased prices for steel and other materials. They reported that ""a lot of suppliers are asking for increases, and the team is battling those requests."" President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum in March. However, on Tuesday he postponed imposition of the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the EU until June 1 and reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil. Miscellaneous products manufacturers described the tariffs as ""very concerning"" and said ""business planning is at a standstill until they are resolved."" Manufacturers of fabricated metal products said the steel tariffs had made it difficult to source material, ""and we have had to eliminate two products due to availability and cost of raw material."" ""Tariffs could add downside risks to factory production and increase input costs in the months ahead,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. The ISM's measure of factory employment dropped in April. Transport equipment manufacturers said while business was robust, capacity constraints were a headache. They described labor as remaining ""tight and getting tighter.""  Those sentiments were also shared by food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers who said shortages of trucks and drivers had impacted delivery times. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING TUMBLES Despite the second straight monthly drop in the ISM index, manufacturing remains underpinned by a firming global economy as well as a weakening U.S. dollar, which is boosting the competitiveness of American-made goods on the global market. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried about inflation. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries slipped.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in March as a sharp decline in homebuilding and renovations led to the biggest drop in investment in private construction projects in more than seven years. Construction spending tumbled 1.7 percent. February data was revised to show construction spending increasing 1.0 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending accelerating 0.5 percent in March. Construction spending rose 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. In March, spending on private construction projects declined 2.1 percent. That was the largest fall since January 2011 and followed a 1.2 percent increase in February.  Outlays on private residential projects plunged 3.5 percent, the biggest drop since April 2009, after advancing 1.2 percent in February. Spending on both single and multifamily housing projects fell in March. Spending on home renovation dropped 8.0 percent last month. Economists expected the construction data would subtract one-tenth of a percentage point from the government's 2.3 percent annualized growth rate estimate for first-quarter gross domestic product, which was published last Friday. ""We expect residential construction spending to grow in 2018 on our thesis that while home building is being constrained by supply issues, the demographic demand for housing units exceeds supply,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

58,2018-05-01,I Have a Real-Life Wicked Stepmother. How Do I Handle Her?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/style/wicked-stepmother.html,1063," The Sweet spot A young woman wants to model healthy relationships for her half brother, but she can hardly stand his mother. By Cheryl Strayed and Steve Almond Dear Sugars, I’m 21 years old and still incapable of dealing with my stepmother. When I was 10, just months after my parents’ divorce, my father told me he was dating a new woman. I tried to act indifferent to the news, but later I sobbed to my mother. She comforted me by saying it wouldn’t be a bad thing to have another adult in my life who would love me. She was mistaken. Two years later, my dad told me his girlfriend was pregnant, and soon after, they married. On their wedding day, my stepmother pulled me aside and said: “You’re not who I would have chosen for a stepchild, but you’re who I’ve got.” I was 12. My relationship with my dad and his wife became increasingly stilted throughout my teenage years. What complicated this disconnection was the small human who shared my DNA and whom I adored. My half brother and I are separated by 12 years, but I love him with my whole heart.  A few years ago, the four of us took a family vacation. Tensions ran high, and the feelings I’d been having for years bubbled over. I told them I felt like an outsider and a second-class citizen in my own home — like I was a blight on an otherwise perfect family of three. Since then, I’ve maintained relationships with my brother and father, but not my stepmother. My brother, who’s now 8, often asks me why I don’t speak to his mom, who still constantly throws passive-aggressive remarks my way. If it were up to me, I’d cut her out of my life entirely, but I have to set a good example for my brother. What should I do? Second-Rate Sibling  Cheryl Strayed: Your letter is an articulation of the precise pickle many stepchildren find themselves in, Sibling. You’re profoundly connected to someone you don’t like by people you love very much. I sympathize. You say you wish to set a good example for your brother, and I want to assure you that you’re already doing that. By honestly communicating how you feel in the family your father made with his wife, you modeled something quite important to your brother.  Many of the letters we receive are from people whose problems are caused by their inability to speak truth, so give yourself some credit for having the courage to do that. I suggest you harness that brave truth-telling spirit once again and have another, calmer, but equally frank conversation with your stepmother — this one motivated not by tensions, but realities: the two of you would prefer to have nothing to do with each other, but since that’s not an option, you’d both benefit from finding a way to get along. The goal of the conversation I’m suggesting isn’t to convince your stepmother to be more loving or welcoming to you; your explosion of a few years ago was an attempt at that, and nothing changed. It’s to negotiate a truce. Steve Almond: I couldn’t agree more, both with the notion that you’ve modeled for your brother courage and candor (and should be proud of that), and that the time has come to confront the lingering tensions between you and your stepmother. To this end, it’s worth re-examining the particular circumstances that forced the two of you together. Your dad got involved with your stepmom “just months” after your parents’ divorce, a period during which you were no doubt still feeling raw and confused by the split. You were probably also troubled, and rightfully so, that your father would jump into another serious relationship so quickly. Your stepmother made things worse with that astonishingly cruel statement (“you’re not who I would have chosen as a stepchild”). This comment arose not from your stepmother’s inherent cruelty, but from her insecurity and weakness. That may be cold comfort to you, but I think it’s important to recognize that any parent who would say something so undermining to a child is clearly struggling with their own self-worth. That doesn’t mean that you have to accept her abuse, passive-aggressive or otherwise. On the contrary, the conversation you need to have with her should set a clear boundary, one that forces her to confront how her cruelty makes you feel. But I do think the conversation will go better if you realize that all bullies are, beneath their snarling masks, scared to death.  CS: By suggesting that you attempt to quell the antagonism between you and your stepmother, we aren’t saying your hurt feelings are unjustified. They are. But I don’t think fighting with your stepmother is going to resolve your sense of loss and betrayal. As Steve aptly notes, your stepmother has her own problems. You can’t change her, but you can change the way you respond to her by learning how to give her less power over you. We do this by setting healthy boundaries and also by exploring the deeper issues that almost always underlie our problems. You wrote to us about your stepmother, but it’s your father who has betrayed you by allowing his wife to treat you unkindly from the start. I encourage you to put your emotional energy there as you attempt to resolve your feelings about being an outsider in this branch of your family, preferably with the help of a therapist.  SA: As always, Cheryl is one step ahead of me and right on stride. It would be terrific if you could make peace with your stepmother, but it’s your father who’s the biggest source of disappointment here. He’s the one whose love and support you need. He was also the adult making the decisions when you were a child. Those included his decision to marry a woman who undermined your sense of familial belonging. To the extent he knew you were hurting back then, he failed to protect you. And to the extent he knows this now, he’s still failing. I would absolutely seek out a therapist to discuss all of this, if that’s possible. This might seem scary because you may feel that you’re asking him to “take sides.” But you’re not. You’re asking him simply to see you, to acknowledge your feelings and comfort you. That’s not too much to ask. It’s what every loving parent should do, especially when their actions have cast doubt on that love.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
59,2018-05-01,What Happens When People and Companies Are Both Just ‘Brands’?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/magazine/what-happens-when-people-and-companies-are-both-just-brands.html,1527," First Words By Amanda Hess Some ideas are bigger than others. Some even grow so large that they turn into paradigms, their logic organizing the way we see everything around them. And if you’re uncertain what framework dominates modern life, well, you can take it from the TED conference fixture and Advertising for Humanity founder Dan Pallotta, who put it bluntly enough in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review: “Brand is everything, and everything is brand.” He was writing in the service of building his own brand, which is about rebranding other people’s brands. The brand, in fact, is such a ubiquitous organizing principle for so many things — companies, products, people — that it has been forced to spawn an expansive glossary of subcategories and varieties. There are “public brands” (civic institutions), “brand extensions” (new products from existing brands), “fighter brands” (cheaper brands released by costlier brands to reattract lost brand loyalty) and “brand leaders” (the very best brands). Even aspects of branding itself are branded, with “brand managers” (marketers) building “brand equity” (likability) through the cultivation of “brandface” (the way the consumer sees herself when she engages with the brand). The apotheosis of all this might be the “lifestyle brand” — a corporate bid to escape the humdrum reality of selling products and instead market an entire way of being. Taco Bell is entering the category with a Forever 21 clothing line targeted at “making wardrobes a whole lot saucier.” Lexus has chased the luxury lifestyle into the sea by introducing a yacht. A vice president for Good Foods describes its guacamole as part of “a lifestyle brand that adds optimum nutrition and wellness, along with the fun factor that can be enjoyed during holidays like Cinco de Mayo.” Anything that can be consumed is now understood as a brand — and on the internet, that’s every last bit of content. This is how a consultant like Eric Garland can, on the strength of a viral tweet storm about the “game theory” behind American politics, brand himself as a Russian conspiracy sage and market subscriptions to @gametheorytoday. It’s also why actual brands, like Hamburger Helper or Denny’s, hang around social media masquerading as people, posting jokes and memes and roasting haters. Even the most cynical internet users speak semiseriously about our posts being “on brand” or “off brand.” There is no refuge from the logic of the brand — and if there is, some up-and-coming strategist will soon enough bolster her own brand by colonizing it. Corporate branding first emerged as a practical measure. In the 1920s, the rise of American consumer culture produced a glut of products that couldn’t be differentiated from one another on sight. The branding that emerged around them has, at points, had a glimmer of utility to it, serving as a way to establish the authenticity and reliability of a particular thing from a particular source. But the idea of a “brand” rapidly spread beyond that seal of quality and subsumed a whole constellation of sentiments a company might provoke in a person, many of them wholly abstracted from the product itself. In her 1999 book, “No Logo,” Naomi Klein presents the acceleration of corporate branding as a kind of hollowing out: Companies that used to manufacture wares or harvest foods — that used to sell things — became brands, which sell ideas. Actual production processes became secondary, outsourced to far-flung subcontractors. The brand’s real investment was to imbue the products with meaning. “Nike isn’t a running-shoe company,” Klein wrote in the 10th-anniversary edition, “it is about the idea of transcendence through sports.” At its core, branding is a process of humanization: It imbues companies with personalities. Often the personification is overt. Once there were Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker; now there’s the Trump Organization and Fenty Beauty. As the celebrity adman Bruce Barton once said: “Institutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls.” A company with a soul becomes relatable, but in a deceptive way: The more we think of it as a “brand,” the more our focus shifts away from things like labor practices and supply chains and onto issues of narrative and identity. So Wendy’s, which used to be personified by a little red-haired girl or by its founder, Dave Thomas, is now personified by a social-media team renowned for its ability to tweet like a rude teenager. But if companies have come to act more like people, the reverse is also true: Now people act like companies, carefully monitoring the meanings we project into the world. The “brand management” of the Wendy’s team happens right alongside that of actual teenagers, who shape their images to attract attention and good will. Build up enough of those things, and a person, much like a company, can become profitable. A blockbuster persona like Rihanna’s might translate into the marketability of a $59 “body luminizer”; a “Bachelor” contestant’s persona might be limited to endorsing herbal supplements on Instagram; a popular internet figure might simply crowdfund to cover expenses. Companies still try to sell us things, but now we’re encouraged to pitch ourselves to them, too. A “lifestyle brand,” after all, is just a regular brand that appeals to people’s “personal brands” — which, in turn, are increasingly organized around courting relationships with lifestyle brands. It all collapses into branding. “Personal brand” was coined by a writer named Tom Peters in a Fast Company article, “The Brand Called You.” This was in 1997, as lifestyle branding was beginning to emerge: “All kinds of products,” Peters wrote, “are figuring out how to transcend the narrow boundaries of their categories and become a brand surrounded by Tommy Hilfiger-like buzz.” At the end of the essay, he plugged his new CD-ROM. Part of what Peters envisioned was human beings’ thinking of themselves in the same way. The internet had made people identical, too, just messages stacked in a virtual box; like the snacks and sneakers that came before them, they needed ways to differentiate themselves. Where “The Brand Called You” becomes fascinating, though, is when it applies this logic to employment. Peters saw personal branding as a way to liberate yourself from the constraints of corporate life; he described lifelong steady employment as “what we used to call indentured servitude.” In its place, he hailed the emergence of a new “project world,” where work “is organized into bite-sized packets.” To thrive in such a world, he encouraged readers to collect and market skills and connections — to throw out their résumés in favor of a “marketing brochure for brand You.” He imagined empowered workers divesting themselves from corporate drudgery, but what actually happened was the opposite: Our corporations divested from us. Over the two decades since “The Brand Called You,” full-time employment has steadily atomized into casual, part-time and temporary work, culminating in the “project world” of the gig economy — microjobs driving for Uber, running errands for TaskRabbit or cooking up side hustles on Fiverr, a company whose subway ads glamorize pitiless overwork (“sleep deprivation is your drug of choice”) despite its being named after a woefully small amount of cash. The opportunities to market ourselves online are never-ending, but the financial rewards remain elusive. Headlines heralding the multimillion-dollar incomes of YouTube stars can make cultivating a brand there seem like a real career option, but a recent study found that even channels among the top 3 percent of viewership can bring in as little as $16,800 a year. (When a would-be YouTube star opened fire in the company’s offices, it was perhaps the first workplace shooting of the gig economy.) Marketing money flows through Instagram, but few of the “influencers” there see much of it; the Cornell professor Brooke Erin Duffy has described them as engaging in “aspirational labor,” a “mode of (mostly) uncompensated, independent work that is propelled by the much-venerated ideal of getting paid to do what you love.” They burnish their brands based on the unspoken assumption that a successful brand leads naturally to actual success. But this tricky conversion rarely takes place, and the work behind it tends to be less valuable to us than it is, in the aggregate, to the companies that facilitate it. All the time I thought I was building my own brand, seeding the internet with personal information in a bid to dominate the Google results — fending off challengers like Amanda Hess, the saintly doctor who delayed giving birth in order to deliver another woman’s baby first — I was enriching any number of tech companies. Tom Peters encouraged us to break the chains of the corporate world in favor of pursuing a life of autonomous creativity. But now branding has taken over not just work but life itself, seizing control of our appearances, our social relationships, even our approach to civil society. After Starbucks staff called the police on two black men waiting in one of their stores — then closed 8,000 locations to conduct bias training for employees — a Forbes contributor praised the company for showing “brand purpose and promise” that could “provide direction for both Starbucks and society at large.” Even in the age of the personal brand, corporations rule.

60,2018-05-01,Correction: Iconic Pen Story,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/01/us/ap-us-iconic-pen.html,731," By The Associated Press GREENSBORO, N.C. — In a story April 27 about iconic SKILCRAFT pens, The Associated Press reported the incorrect Celsius equivalent for a Fahrenheit temperature included in the pen's specifications. The pens must be able to write at -40 degrees Celsius, not 4 degrees Celsius. A corrected version of the story is below: Iconic pen used by military, made by blind people turns 50 Anyone who's served in the military, worked for the federal government or addressed a package at the post office is familiar with an iconic pen made for 50 years by visually impaired people By JONATHAN DREW Associated Press GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Clifford Alexander scoops a handful of black ballpoint pens, drops them into a small box and shakes it with a blackjack dealer's nonchalance. He slides in the next handful to make an exact dozen, and sends the box down the assembly line. Alexander, who is blind, performs the quick act again, box after box. Anyone who's served in the military, worked for the federal government or addressed a package at the post office is familiar with the handiwork. But they might not have realized that all the ubiquitous SKILCRAFT U.S. Government pens were made by the visually impaired. The pens turn 50 this month. The pen's history traces back to April 20, 1968, when it was introduced to government buyers, said the National Industries for the Blind. The nonprofit organization was tapped to supply pens after another manufacturer made 13 million defective ballpoints in 1967. The pens have stringent requirements — 16 pages worth. The pens must be able to write a continuous line about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) long and keep the ink flowing despite extreme temperatures — from 40 degrees below zero to 160 degrees (-40 to 71 degrees Celsius). For five decades, the task of making those pens has been entrusted to blind workers. ""It may take us longer to learn it, but once we learn those jobs we do those jobs very well,"" said Alexander, who supervises about 30 Greensboro pen workers. ""And we turn out a top quality garment or writing instrument."" The pen is well-known among military and government families after finding its way into purses and backpacks for years. It's also been used by the military as improvised devices to plug holes in pipes on boats or perform emergency medical procedures. The pens are sold to the federal government through a program started in 1938 to create jobs for people with disabilities. In 2016, the AbilityOne program sold $3.3 billion in goods and services, with more than half coming from military orders. Alexander said his 47 years at the North Carolina plant has helped him to buy a home and educate his children. The plant employs about 140 visually impaired people to make products ranging from Army combat jackets to clipboards. In the pen's heyday, the government bought about 70 million per year. Now the Greensboro plant and a second in Milwaukee combine to produce about 8 million of the flagship retractable ballpoints annually, with parts supplied by a third site in Missouri. All three employ visually impaired workers. Lynn Larsen, who's worked at Greensboro Industries of the Blind for 40 years, said the job helped her support her family after her father died. More recently, it was a source of pride when her nephew deployed to Afghanistan with the Army. ""He would tell the other soldiers that his aunt Lynn made that pen, and they thought it was real cool,"" she said. The Greensboro workers earn well above minimum wage and can reach around $24 per hour, said Richard Oliver, the site's director of community outreach and government relations. The benefits go beyond the pay, said Oliver, who is legally blind himself: ""We didn't get the opportunity to serve in the military ... so this is our way to serve."" ""It gives our people a really big sense of pride,"" he said. Steven Gray, a retired Navy lieutenant commander, said he read a number of accident reports about the pens being used aboard ships for emergency tracheotomies during a stint at the Naval Safety Center in Norfolk. ""It was an achievement to actually have your pen run out before you lost it,"" said Gray, who also served at sea on five vessels. ""That was something everybody noticed, 'Hey I actually burned through a SKILCRAFT pen this morning.'"" ___    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
61,2018-05-01,"U.S. Factory Activity Slows Further, Tariff Concerns Grow",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-usa-economy.html,777," By Reuters WASHINGTON — U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April, with manufacturers complaining about rising commodity prices in the wake of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey published on Tuesday also showed shortages of skilled workers, which together with the proposed import tariffs were causing bottlenecks in the supply chain.  Rising raw material costs are the latest indication that inflation pressures are building and could attract the attention of Federal Reserve officials who began a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Data on Monday showed a jump in annual inflation rates in March. In addition, wages grew at their quickest pace in 11 years in the first quarter. ""It supports our view that the Fed will raise interest rates three additional times this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is underestimating the amount of developing inflation pressures."" The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates when it concludes its meeting on Wednesday. The Fed increased borrowings costs in March and has forecast at least two more rate hikes for this year. The ISM said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.3 last month from 59.3 in March. A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The survey's prices paid index increased 1.2 points to 79.3, the highest reading since April 2011. Last month, price increases occurred across 17 of 18 industry sectors. Machinery manufacturers said tariffs had increased prices for steel and other materials. They reported that ""a lot of suppliers are asking for increases, and the team is battling those requests."" President Donald Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminium in March. However, on Tuesday he postponed imposition of the tariffs on Canada, Mexico and the EU until June 1 and reached agreements for permanent exemptions for Argentina, Australia and Brazil. Miscellaneous products manufacturers described the tariffs as ""very concerning"" and said ""business planning is at a standstill until they are resolved."" Manufacturers of fabricated metal products said the steel tariffs had made it difficult to source material, ""and we have had to eliminate two products due to availability and cost of raw material."" ""Tariffs could add downside risks to factory production and increase input costs in the months ahead,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. The ISM's measure of factory employment dropped in April. Transport equipment manufacturers said while business was robust, capacity constraints were a headache. They described labour as remaining ""tight and getting tighter.""  Those sentiments were also shared by food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers who said shortages of trucks and drivers had impacted delivery times. CONSTRUCTION SPENDING TUMBLES Despite the second straight monthly drop in the ISM index, manufacturing remains underpinned by a firming global economy as well as a weakening U.S. dollar, which is boosting the competitiveness of American-made goods on the global market. Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried about inflation. The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasuries slipped.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in March as a sharp decline in homebuilding and renovations led to the biggest drop in investment in private construction projects in more than seven years. Construction spending tumbled 1.7 percent. February data was revised to show construction spending increasing 1.0 percent instead of the previously reported 0.1 percent gain. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending accelerating 0.5 percent in March. Construction spending rose 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis. In March, spending on private construction projects declined 2.1 percent. That was the largest fall since January 2011 and followed a 1.2 percent increase in February.  Outlays on private residential projects plunged 3.5 percent, the biggest drop since April 2009, after advancing 1.2 percent in February. Spending on both single and multifamily housing projects fell in March. Spending on home renovation dropped 8.0 percent last month. Economists expected the construction data would subtract one-tenth of a percentage point from the government's 2.3 percent annualised growth rate estimate for first-quarter gross domestic product, which was published last Friday. ""We expect residential construction spending to grow in 2018 on our thesis that while home building is being constrained by supply issues, the demographic demand for housing units exceeds supply,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

62,2018-05-01,"Wary of Being Left Out, Japan Will Host Chinese and South Korean Leaders",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/world/asia/japan-korea-diplomacy-abe.html,929," By Motoko Rich TOKYO — A blistering pace of meetings to discuss the prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula will continue next week in Tokyo, when Japan hosts a meeting with leaders from China and South Korea. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced on Tuesday during a visit to Amman, Jordan, that he would host President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Premier Li Keqiang of China in Tokyo on May 9. The meeting would put Japan back into the diplomatic fray after it had looked increasingly isolated, with the primary discussions about North Korea progressing without it. Mr. Abe had spent the past year cultivating a close relationship with President Trump and hewing to the United States’ hard-line approach to North Korea, only to be caught by surprise when Mr. Trump abruptly accepted an invitation to talk with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “A trilateral summit in Tokyo is an opportunity for Abe to reassert himself in fast-moving regional politics in a way that does not depend on his relationship with the U.S. president,” said Mira Rapp-Hooper, a senior research scholar at Yale Law School who writes about security in Asia. Speaking in Amman, where Japan announced grants of up to 1.63 billion yen, about $15 million, to help Jordan support an influx of Syrian refugees, Mr. Abe said he planned to discuss “all aspects of the future development of relationships between Japan and China, and Japan and South Korea” at the meeting next week. He added that he would push for more “concrete actions” from North Korea to flesh out the commitment to denuclearization that Mr. Kim discussed with Mr. Moon in historic talks in the border village of Panmunjom last Friday. Of the three leaders convening in Tokyo next week, Mr. Abe, who has lately been dogged by influence-peddling scandals at home, is perhaps most in need of a domestic boost. Undoubtedly, all three leaders will want to talk about advancing the North Korean peace process. But the unusual personality and style of President Trump is an equally urgent topic. “A lot of the stimulus for this diplomacy in northeast Asia is certainly the North Korean threat,” said Mireya Solis, co-director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution. “But they are also dealing with this president, who is in so many ways changing the parameters of U.S. foreign policy.” The meeting will provide an opportunity for the three leaders to discuss commercial ties, at a time when the United States is threatening a trade war with China and has recently renegotiated a two-way trade agreement with South Korea. It will be the first visit to Japan by Mr. Moon since he was elected president last May, and the first visit to Tokyo by a South Korean president in more than six years. Mr. Li would be the first Chinese premier to visit Japan in eight years. With the region’s dynamics shifting rapidly, Mr. Abe will not be in the driver’s seat. He has been looking to secure a meeting with Mr. Li in the hopes of visiting Beijing this summer and ultimately hosting President Xi Jinping in Tokyo before the end of the year. But China has dragged its feet in agreeing to set dates. “Whenever Japan would call they were basically saying ‘Well, we’ll check our schedule book and get back to you,’” said J. Berkshire Miller, a senior visiting fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo. And South Korea, which had typically been a backseat player in northeast Asia, is now emerging as a leading broker of the North Korean peace negotiations. “Traditionally it was really Japan and China leading, with South Korea being the shrimp between two whales,” Mr. Miller said. “But now you have the scenario where, after the Kim-Moon summit, both sides will be very actively talking to President Moon to understand what’s happening on the Korean Peninsula. It’s an interesting change of scenario.” At next week’s summit, the challenge for Japan is to establish a significant role for itself in the diplomatic gyrations. “The biggest source of tension is really what role Japan can play in this process,” said Tobias Harris, an expert on Japanese politics at Teneo Intelligence in Washington. “China is North Korea’s backstop, and they might nudge North Korea in the direction of constructive concessions that lower the temperature. Obviously South Korea is playing this role of drawing North Korea out and almost in some ways speaking on behalf of North Korea before much of the world. But it’s not quite clear what Japan’s role in all of this is going to be.” Japan clearly has its own agenda of ensuring that Mr. Trump does not agree to a deal that would accept North Korea giving up intercontinental ballistic missiles and future nuclear tests while retaining short- and medium-range missiles that could still hit Japan. In talking with South Korea and China, Mr. Abe will want to make sure his country does not get “dragged along with relaxing sanctions because it’s facing pressure from China, South Korea and the U.S. to play a good sport and support an agreement” without protecting Japan’s interests, Mr. Harris said. Mr. Abe is also particularly keen to reach some kind of resolution for the families of  Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean spies four decades ago, and will undoubtedly reiterate his request for support from South Korea. And in hopes of continuing a trend toward warmer ties with China, Mr. Abe will host separate one-on-one talks with Mr. Li during his visit to Tokyo next week.       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
63,2018-05-01,"Rushed Testing, Poor Communication Played Role in British TSB Outage-Contractors",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/business/01reuters-britain-tsb.html,773," By Reuters LONDON — A computer systems migration at Britain's TSB bank that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to access their accounts was hindered by rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication, two contractors who worked on the project said. TSB, bought in 2015 by Spain's Sabadell Bank from Lloyds Banking Group, was migrating to Sabadell's in-house developed system, Proteo, from legacy systems for which it had been paying Lloyds around a hundred million pounds a year.  TSB customers started reporting problems making bill and mortgage payments within hours of the migration over the weekend of April 21-22. On Tuesday, clients were still complaining on social media.  Two IT contractors who managed employees involved in the migration up until late last year told Reuters that testing of the different systems was not as thorough as it could have been at that time because TSB rushed as it neared a self-imposed deadline of November 2017, later extended to April 2018. TSB rejected that view, telling Reuters testing was ""extensive"". ""There wasn't time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren't properly scoped, so it wasn't a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn't work,"" said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. ""There were multiple daily failures in Proteo that would go on sometimes for five days and a lack of adequate training on Proteo, meaning testing was conducted based on knowledge of the legacy systems,"" the tester said. The project manager stopped working for the company when his contract ended in December. The tester left around the same time. Both said they have kept in touch with colleagues still working at the bank and were told the situation had not changed.  Reuters contacted several contractors and TSB staff currently working on the project but none were willing to talk. TSB, which has apologised to customers and pledged an investigation, declined to comment on the specific allegations but disputed any shortcomings in its testing. ""We are working round the clock to put things right and to keep our customers informed about the latest position. This is our priority at the moment,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. ""There was extensive testing that was completed before migration. There will of course be an investigation into why the migration did not go as expected.” TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings are due to appear at a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday to explain how the problems occurred and what they are doing to fix them. SOFTWARE UPGRADES Banks around the world face the potential for similar crises as they upgrade aging computer systems after decades of under-investment and stitch together different platforms from a wave of mergers. The sources described the Lloyds system as complicated because it was created by amalgamating many systems as Lloyds acquired rivals leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Banks have been fined in the past for technical problems. The Royal Bank of Scotland was fined 56 million pounds by regulators in 2014 over a botched software upgrade in June 2012 that left millions of customers unable to access accounts. TSB said it will cancel overdraft fees for the month of April and increase interest payments to savers as it tries to prevent a customer exodus in the wake of the outage. Sabadell said it is too early to estimate the costs of the incident. It has had to bring in remedial teams from IBM to help try and stem the crisis, while Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has sent in its own team to investigate. An FCA spokeswoman said: ""We are working with the firm to ensure customers are properly communicated with and are not left out of pocket. We'll be talking to the firm to understand exactly what went wrong.""  On a call to discuss the bank's annual results on Thursday, Pester told Reuters he did not know whether the problem was in infrastructure, servers or the software communications layer. Asked whether the issue could be poor testing and communications, he said he was not aware of problems in those areas.  ""If he (your source) is so knowledgeable, he can come and help IBM fix it,” he said.

66,2018-05-01,Bots and Trolls Elbow Into Mexico’s Crowded Electoral Field,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/world/americas/mexico-election-fake-news.html,1117," By Kirk Semple and Marina Franco MEXICO CITY — The message that circulated on social media earlier this year — most Mexicans would have to re-register within days if they wanted to vote in the presidential election — set off a low-level panic on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. The thing is, it wasn’t true. The source remains unclear. But whether the message was a dirty trickster’s attempt to undermine the system or just an ill-informed public service effort, the anger and uncertainty it generated represented an early skirmish in the battle over disinformation in this year’s fiercely contested election season. “What candidates do on social media will be decisive,” said Carlos Merlo, managing partner of Victory Lab, a marketing firm dedicated to spreading viral claims, saying they must respond quicker than ever to combat disinformation. There is a lot at stake in the July 1 vote: over 3,400 elected positions at the local, state and federal levels, more than in any other election in Mexican history. The biggest prize is the presidency, with five candidates on the ballot competing to succeed President Enrique Peña Nieto for a six-year term. Fake news has been flowing fast, and the campaigns have traded accusations that they have hired paid, online agitators called trolls and used automated programs known as bots to flood social media platforms with messages intended to deceive and manipulate voters. And as investigators in the United States continue to investigate the extent of Russian efforts to sway the 2016 presidential election, the threat of Russian interference has loomed over the Mexican race as well. In a speech in December, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, then the United States national security adviser, said there were “initial signs” that the Russian government was trying to influence the Mexican election, though he provided no details. Mexican officials say they have not found evidence of Russian meddling or received any from their American counterparts, and the Russian authorities have denied engaging in such activity. Enrique Andrade, a top official at Mexico’s National Electoral Institute, said the agency was on guard against any foreign interference. “We do think it is a possibility, and we are preparing ourselves so that it will not affect the process,” he said. Some analysts have speculated that Russia might still try to disrupt the region by intensifying political polarization in Mexico ahead of the vote. And, they say, the Russians may view Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the front-runner in the polls who has cut a more antagonistic figure toward the United States than his rivals, as a useful vehicle for that goal. Manuel Cossío Ramos, a digital strategist, claims to have found Russian fingerprints on social media traffic concerning the election, much of it about Mr. López Obrador. Mr. Cossío is not affiliated with a presidential campaign, but acknowledges being no fan of Mr. López Obrador. Using an analytics tool called NetBase, Mr. Cossío said he found that 4.8 million items about Mr. López Obrador had been posted to social media and news websites in the past month by users outside Mexico. About 63 percent were associated with users in Russia, he said, and 20 percent with Ukraine. Similar searches for two other leading candidates, Ricardo Anaya and José Antonio Meade, found that most of the foreign activity was coming from the United States, with only 4 percent emanating from Russia, Mr. Cossío said. But other digital consultants, running different programs, said they had found no such evidence of election-related social media activity from Russia, and Mr. Cossío’s findings could not be independently verified. Officials with Mr. López Obrador’s campaign have dismissed Mr. Cossío’s findings as biased because of his political inclinations. Mr. López Obrador, meanwhile, has answered the charges of Russian links with satire, posting a video on Twitter showing him waiting at a port in Veracruz for a Russian submarine to bring him “gold from Moscow.” He called himself “Andrés Manuelovich.” The many pieces of fake news that have circulated in Mexico of late include a claim that Pope Francis weighed in on the presidential race and criticized Mr. López Obrador’s political ideology. (He didn’t, according to Verificado 2018, a fact-checking group established in March to verify election-related news.) Another recent claim — also exposed as false by Verificado — held that Mr. Anaya was related to members of the Peña Nieto administration and, thus, his opposition party was in league with it. Some analysts said a law that passed in 2007, which sought to clean up Mexican campaigns by regulating ad purchases, among other things, had the effect of pushing rough-and-tumble politicking onto the internet. In the 2012 presidential election, the online battle was bruising. A Mexican web developer, Iván Santiesteban, concluded that around 20,000 bots were used in the month and a half before Election Day 2012 to create online conversations favorable to Mr. Peña Nieto. About 1,000 people worked with the Peña Nieto campaign that year to “combat negative comments in social media and instead position the positive ones,” the chief of marketing for the campaign, Aurelio Nuño, has said. Since then, the online audience has nearly doubled: about 71.3 million internet users in Mexico, according to the latest census data, up from 40.9 million in 2012. At the same time, the campaigns have become more adept at designing online strategies. “From this point on, the battle will be fought on the social networks,” said Javier Murillo, co-founder and chairman of Metrics, a digital technology consultancy in Mexico. Using proprietary algorithms, Mr. Murillo said he found that bots and trolls generated up to 27 percent of election postings on Facebook and Twitter in Mexico during a recent monthlong period. Digital consultants working with the campaigns of the three leading presidential candidates — Mr. Lopez Obrador, Mr. Anaya and Mr. Meade — denied that the campaigns were using such methods, or spreading fake news. “Social media is now an obligatory part of any campaign war room,” said Mr. Anaya’s digital strategist, Juan Pablo Adame Alemán. “But we see no benefit to inflating topics” with bots or trolls. In an effort to get ahead of the problem as Election Day draws closer, Mexican authorities have reached agreements with Facebook, Twitter and Google on ways to counteract fake news and spread accurate information. Facebook, as part of its agreement, placed ads in Mexican newspapers this spring providing guidance on how to detect fake news. Election officials have been particularly worried about rumors that seem intended to undermine the integrity of the system. The message concerning voter registration this year was of the biggest concern to them so far, said Mr. Andrade of the National Electoral Institute. “Then again,” he cautioned, “we are only getting started in terms of the campaign process.”       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
67,2018-05-01,How Samsung Fell Behind Sony and LG in the Premium TV Market,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/technology/01reuters-samsung-elec-tv.html,1279," By Reuters SEOUL — At the 2013 annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, flashy organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions sporting credit card-thin screens were at the front and center of Samsung Electronics' new gadgets display.  Later that year, the South Korean company splurged on marketing the televisions – which then retailed at around $10,000 for the 55-inch model – to the ultra wealthy. Among the promotions was a penthouse party for the residents of One Hyde Park in London, labeled the world's most expensive residential block.  But by 2015, it had stopped making OLED TVs, saying the market was not ready to embrace the high costs of the technology – based on thin films of carbon-based modules that light up in response to electric current. Instead it decided to focus on developing liquid crystal display screens that are backlit and enhanced with so-called quantum dots, semiconductor nanocrystals that produce colors and can improve picture quality. These are known as QLED TVs.  It appears to have been a costly misstep. OLED TVs have become a dominant technology in the premium market – that is for a TV of at least 55 inches in size costing more than $2,500 - as the cost of producing them has dropped dramatically.  Samsung is now the only major TV manufacturer not to produce OLED screens. And while the TV business generates less than 3 percent of Samsung’s profit, which largely comes from its semiconductor and mobile phones businesses, the loss of the leadership of the premium, higher-margin market is a hard blow. Samsung declined to comment on whether ending OLED TV production was a costly mistake or who made it. A look at online reviews of both OLED and QLED TVs in the past couple of years indicate that OLED TVs made by South Korea’s LG Electronics and Japan’s Sony gained fans because of the quality of the picture. In particular, reviewers cited more realistic colors and high resolution, as well as attractive designs and increasingly reasonable prices.  That doesn’t mean the Samsung QLED TVs don’t have their supporters. Picture quality has also improved and prices have dropped but they don’t tend to be reviewers’ top picks.  ""OLED TV's jump in premium TV market share is a direct result of its outstanding picture quality,"" said Ross Young, CEO of research provider Display Supply Chain Consultants. ""Samsung may have missteped in their 2017 product by emphasizing design over picture performance."" Samsung last year only got an 18.5 percent share of global sales for premium TVs, based on dollar revenue, down from 54.7 percent in 2015, according to research firm IHS Markit. Meanwhile, Sony and LG have leapfrogged Samsung to grab 36.9 percent and 33 percent of the market respectively.  To be sure, Samsung remains the biggest maker of TVs in the world – a title it has now held for 12 years. It also claims to be No.1 in premium TVs, with more than a 40 percent market share, based on data from GfK. These figures include 55-inch TVs that are cheaper than the $2,500 IHS uses to define the segment.  MORE EFFICIENT MANUFACTURING  Samsung Electronics’ decision to base its TV business on LCD technology was made after it took the advice of Samsung Group's now-defunct Corporate Strategy Office, a source with knowledge of the matter said.  ""The office made a suggestion that it would be more profitable to focus on LCDs than switching to less-proven OLED,"" said the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.  The reasons: the TV business was battling falling profits and the company felt LCD technology could be more profitable than high cost OLED, the source said.  The only problem was that around the time this decision was being taken, LG was developing a much more efficient manufacturing process to make OLED screens.  The retail price of a mainstream LG 55-inch OLED TV has dropped to just 3 million won ($2,811) this year from 15 million won ($14,056) in 2013, LG said.  It is not the first time decisions involving Samsung’s Corporate Strategy Office have been questioned. The office, which was led by then Samsung Electronics vice chairman Choi Gee-sung, was closed after it faced criticism during the political scandal that led to the arrest of the group's heir Jay Y. Lee last year on charges of bribery and embezzlement. Lee, who denies any wrongdoing, walked out a free man in February after an appeals court suspended his sentence.  Samsung told Reuters the biggest reason it is not making OLED TVs is the issue of screen burn-in, referring to a form of image retention when an image has been on the screen for a long time.  LG, though, says on its U.S. website that while burn-in is possible on almost any display, it has addressed the issue through technology that protects against damage to the screen and rectifies short-term problems.  PROFIT FIGURES TELL THE TALE  The struggle's impact on corporate results became clearer last month. LG said on Thursday its TV division recorded a 77 percent jump in quarterly profit and a record profit margin of 14 percent in the quarter ended in March.  Samsung reported a 32 percent quarterly profit decline last Thursday for its consumer electronics division that sells TVs and home appliances, saying that earnings fell from a year ago, partly because it had changed its lineup and stopped selling some lower and mid-priced TVs.  Sony, whose television business incurred losses totaling 800 billion yen ($7.4 billion) over ten years, swung back to a profit in the year ended in March 2017.  To return to profit, the Japanese company reduced the number of markets around the world in which it sells, diversified suppliers and offered both OLED and LCD screens. It also ditched an LCD joint venture with Samsung.  The strategy paid off. While Sony had just 10.2 percent share in the global TV market last year in dollar terms, it was No. 1 in the premium market. Its operating profit margin reached 10.7 percent in the September-December quarter, according to John Soh, analyst at Shinhan Investment. The outlook for Samsung in premium TVs could worsen as 71 percent of sales this year are expected to be OLED TVs, up from 51 percent last year, according to IHS. And this is all happening with the 2018 FIFA World Cup starting in June. The month-long soccer competition, which is being held in Russia this year, is consistently the most watched TV event in the world and provides TV makers with a great opportunity to boost sales. Choong Hoon Yi, head of UBI Research and a former Samsung display engineer, said that it now ""looks like Samsung made a mistake"" though it did not seem a blunder at the time, as Samsung considered the OLED technology too immature. When asked about whether it plans to restart OLED TV production and sales, Samsung reiterated its previous stance that it will focus on other more competitive technology.  ""There's no change (in our strategy),"" Jonghee Han, President of Samsung's TV business told reporters last month.  Some display analysts say all might not be lost as Samsung can fight back on price.  Initially the U.S. price for Samsung's mid-range Q7F 55-inch QLED TV in 2018 was $1,900, down from $2,500 last year, according to online channels. Meanwhile the initial price for LG's 55-inch C7 OLED TV was $3,500 in 2017 but the corresponding C8 started at $2,500 this year.  ""Our goal is not to be No. 1 for x-number of consecutive years, but No. 1 forever,"" Samsung’s Han said.

The caviar sandwich, priced under $15 dollars, briefly disappeared from the Oyster Bar's menu several months ago after the cost of bowfin caviar soared. Executive Chef Sandy Ingber tells The Wall Street Journal that the options were to either get rid of the sandwich or increase the price. Ingber says the item was reinstated two weeks ago after he found another source of low-cost caviar in Boston. The caviar sandwich is served with chopped hard-boiled eggs on toasted white bread. Ingber says the item is not a huge seller, but it has a number of die-hard fans.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
69,2018-05-02,How Samsung Fell Behind Sony and LG in the Premium TV Market,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-samsung-elec-tv.html,1321," By Reuters SEOUL — At the 2013 annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, flashy organic light-emitting diode (OLED) televisions sporting credit card-thin screens were at the front and center of Samsung Electronics' new gadgets display.  Later that year, the South Korean company splurged on marketing the televisions – which then retailed at around $10,000 for the 55-inch model – to the ultra wealthy. Among the promotions was a penthouse party for the residents of One Hyde Park in London, labeled the world's most expensive residential block.  But by 2015, it had stopped making OLED TVs, saying the market was not ready to embrace the high costs of the technology – based on thin films of carbon-based modules that light up in response to electric current. Instead it decided to focus on developing liquid crystal display screens that are backlit and enhanced with so-called quantum dots, semiconductor nanocrystals that produce colors and can improve picture quality. These are known as QLED TVs.  It appears to have been a costly misstep. OLED TVs have become a dominant technology in the premium market – that is for a TV of at least 55 inches in size costing more than $2,500 - as the cost of producing them has dropped dramatically.  Samsung is now the only major TV manufacturer not to produce OLED screens. And while the TV business generates less than 3 percent of Samsung’s profit, which largely comes from its semiconductor and mobile phones businesses, the loss of the leadership of the premium, higher-margin market is a hard blow. ""It was based on an objective appraisal of technological and cost competitiveness,"" Jongsuk Chu, head of sales and marketing for Samsung's TV business, told Reuters in a statement, referring to its decision to discontinue making OLED TVs. A look at online reviews of both OLED and QLED TVs in the past couple of years indicate that OLED TVs made by South Korea’s LG Electronics and Japan’s Sony gained fans because of the quality of the picture. In particular, reviewers cited more realistic colors and high resolution, as well as attractive designs and increasingly reasonable prices.  That doesn’t mean the Samsung QLED TVs don’t have their supporters. Picture quality has also improved and prices have dropped but they don’t tend to be reviewers’ top picks.

New Zealand have not played in Pakistan since 2003 due to security concerns but had been asked to play Twenty20 matches in the country later this year, governing body New Zealand Cricket said. ""NZC has received a request from the PCB chairman for New Zealand to play in Pakistan,"" an NZC spokesman said. ""At the moment NZC is doing due diligence on the request and consulting with security providers, the government, and the players. ""We will respond to the PCB when this process has been completed."" The Black Caps are scheduled to play tests and one-day internationals against Pakistan in November at the United Arab Emirates, the country's designated 'home' base. No dates have been issued for those matches but the spokesman said they would be played in the UAE.  Pakistan has remained largely starved of international cricket since the 2009 attacks on a bus carrying Sri Lanka's team in Lahore, which wounded six players and a British coach, and killed eight Pakistanis. But Sri Lanka returned to the country for a Twenty20 match in Lahore in October and West Indies played a recent T20 series in Karachi. New Zealand abandoned their last test tour of Pakistan in 2002 after a bomb exploded outside their Karachi hotel but returned to play an ODI series in 2003. Pakistan media, citing an unnamed source in the national cricket board, reported that Australia had also been approached to play in the country. Australia are scheduled to play tests and limited overs matches against Pakistan at the UAE later in the year, likely starting in September or October. Cricket Australia declined to confirm the approach but said their next series against Pakistan would remain in the Middle East. ""The safety and security of Australian players is our number one priority,"" a CA spokesman said. ""From an Australia team perspective, we are not contemplating moving our current bilateral-tour arrangements from taking on Pakistan in the Middle East, when they host the next series.""

71,2018-05-02,"Peppa Pig Wins Street Cred, Attracts Censors in China",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/asia/ap-as-china-peppa-censored.html,740," By The Associated Press BEIJING — A cherubic British cartoon character has become an unlikely target of China's censors as fans use her porcine likeness in rap videos and ""gangster"" tattoos. The bright pink swine's subversive alter-ego has made her a viral hit but also an apparent target of government workers who police the internet. Videos with the hashtag #PeppaPig could not be searched Wednesday on Douyin, a popular video app. The catchphrase, ""Get a tattoo of Peppa Pig, give a round of applause to 'gangsters,'"" was also not searchable on the Weibo microblogging platform, which posted a message saying it was acting ""in accordance with relevant legal regulations."" Regulators have been ratcheting up control over Chinese blogs and apps in recent months. A controversial cybersecurity law was introduced last June as part of President Xi Jinping's efforts to tighten control over what China's public can see and say online while still trying to reap the economic benefits of internet use. It was not clear whether the censorship of Peppa on Douyin was prompted by a government mandate. Bytedance saw its social networking app Neihan Duanzi shut down by the State Adminstration of Radio and Television last month. The app was a hub for GIFs, memes and often-vulgar humor which the authorities deemed ""unhealthy."" The company's chief executive, Zhang Yiming, said in an apologetic statement at the time that he would increase the size of the content-monitoring team to 10,000 employees. Chinese media said there had been at least 30,000 clips under Peppa's hashtag on Douyin. Variations on the name, such as ""PigPig"" or ""PeppaPeppa"" are still searchable. In a statement to The Associated Press, Douyin denied that it has ""banned"" Peppa Pig. But a source close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on its behalf said Douyin removed some user-generated videos featuring Peppa Pig that the company deemed inappropriate. Internet users have aligned Peppa with the culture of ""shehuiren"" — literally ""society people"" — which connotes a gangster attitude and street smarts. The Global Times, a state-run newspaper, wrote Monday that the moniker ""refers to people who run counter to the mainstream value and are usually poorly educated with no stable job. They are unruly slackers roaming around and the antithesis of the young generation the (ruling Communist) Party tries to cultivate."" The party newspaper People's Daily likewise warned last week that Peppa ""should not be allowed to destroy children's childhoods."" It noted that Peppa has been used to sell merchandise not connected with the original brand. Xi, who strives to rally citizens around the idea of a ""China Dream,"" has emphasized in speeches the importance of young people's contributions to the country's ""rejuvenation"" following foreign incursions and civil war over the last 150 years. Despite such entreaties from the Communist Party, a number of internet subcultures fueled largely by young Chinese — from despondent ""sang"" people to lackadaisical ""Buddhist youths"" — have resisted the president's call to ""roll up your sleeves and work harder."" Peppa Pig is not the first fictional creature to be targeted by China's censors for political and sociological reasons. References to Winnie the Pooh were recently scrubbed from the internet after users began employing the cuddly bear as a proxy for the somewhat corpulent Xi when he engineered a move this year to remove presidential term limits from the constitution. Among the popular postings, Winnie was shown hugging a jar of honey alongside the quote, ""find the thing you love and stick with it."" On her show, Peppa and her animal friends partake in mundane activities such as bike riding and swimming. But ""society people"" have co-opted innocuous lines from the program for their own satirical takes, such as playing lewd rap songs after a scene in which Peppa says: ""I like this. It's very grown-up."" The topic ""'Society Person' Peppa Pig"" has been viewed nearly 30 million times on Weibo, with fans sharing photos of themselves and Peppa paraphernalia along with the tag ""society person."" Some users have juxtaposed images of Peppa with racy pop lyrics, or edited Peppa videos to include techno lighting. Users also encouraged one another to get Peppa tattoos. Tens of thousands have purchased temporary tattoos featuring the pig on e-commerce site Taobao. In a post reflecting on Peppa's puzzling popularity, verified Weibo blogger Cao Zhi mused, ""Peppa Society People have added a bit of fun and merriment to our dry, tedious lives.""

72,2018-05-02,Amazon Makes Bid to Spoil Walmart-Flipkart Deal: Report,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-flipkart-m-a-amazon-com.html,724," By Reuters BENGALURU/MUMBAI — Amazon.com Inc has made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart, CNBC-TV18 reported on Wednesday, potentially complicating Walmart Inc's bid for majority ownership of the Indian online retailer. The news underscores how Amazon is focused on winning India's fledgling e-commerce market, and the offer could be a ploy to block Walmart from bringing its expertise in logistics and supply chain management to Flipkart, people familiar with the matter said. Reuters reported last month that Walmart was close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, Amazon's biggest rival in India, for $10 billion to $12 billion. The talks with Walmart for what could be its largest acquisition to date are still ongoing, and a deal is expected to be clinched soon, two people told Reuters on Wednesday. However, Amazon was indeed interested in buying Flipkart, said two sources, asking not to be named. They declined to give further details.  A spokesman for Walmart declined to comment. Amazon said it does not offer comments on rumors and speculation, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon's offer could kickstart a new battle between it and Walmart, already fierce retail rivals in the United States. The bid emphasizes the importance of gaining a greater foothold in online sales in India, a market expected to be worth $200 billion a year within a decade. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, touted in a letter to shareholders last month that Amazon was India's fastest growing online marketplace. The world's largest online retailer has been pouring billions of dollars into India to ship goods to shoppers faster, contributing to growing losses internationally. A Walmart-Flipkart deal could lead to more intense price competition, retail consultants said. On Wednesday, Indian broadcaster CNBC-TV18 reported https://bit.ly/2jo03py that Amazon had offered Flipkart a breakup fee of $2 billion to convince it to discuss an offer, which analysts say would bring with it substantial antitrust challenges. Flipkart and Amazon dominate the online shopping space in Asia's third-largest economy. Flipkart had vetoed an approach from Amazon for a 51 to 55 percent stake in the company two years ago, a source told Reuters, judging its offered price as far too low at the time. ""Now with Walmart in the mix things are different,"" the source said. ""To the best of my knowledge no decision has been made yet. There is no deadline per se."" CNBC-TV18, citing unnamed sources, said Amazon's new bid was likely to be on a par with Walmart's, but that Flipkart's investors and founders continue to favor the deal with Walmart, with founder Sachin Bansal overseeing final negotiations. WORLDWIDE MOVES Walmart and Amazon's interest in gaining share in India comes after both retailers have struggled to grow in China, ultimately losing ground to Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  A successful move by Amazon to grab Flipkart would likely send Walmart back to the drawing board when it comes to India, retail consultants and analysts said. ""The stakes are really high for Walmart,"" said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. ""It will be very hard for them to win India back if they miss this opportunity."" Investors expect faster returns from Walmart's investments compared to Amazon, said Yarbrough, a move that limits the brick-and-mortar retailer's ability to spend big on acquisitions in growth markets.  Sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from 2014. In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India. Its urgency to stem market share losses has seen it launch talks to merge its British arm Asda with Sainsbury's. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, McKenna downplayed analyst criticism that the company has been slow to move in India. ""We have been deliberate and thoughtful, we were not slow to respond,"" she said. Walmart's shares ended 1.22 percent lower at $86.34 on Wednesday.

73,2018-05-02,"Italy President Rules Out June Elections, Wants Stopgap Government: Source",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/world/europe/02reuters-italy-politics-election.html,522," By Reuters ROME — President Sergio Mattarella has ruled out calling early national elections in June and wants to unblock Italy's political logjam with a short-term government, a presidential source said on Wednesday. Italy held an inconclusive election in March in which a center-right alliance led by the League won the most seats and the 5-Star Movement emerged as the biggest single party. The center-left Democratic Party (PD) came a distant third. All efforts to forge a coalition have so far failed and, with few options left on the table, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio this week demanded an immediate return to the polls. That spooked financial markets, which fear new elections might bolster the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star at the expense of already bruised mainstream parties in the euro zone's third largest economy. Mattarella serves as the supreme arbiter in Italian politics and a source in his office said the head of state would not call a June vote, preferring instead to bide his time and try to find a government to put together a 2019 budget. ""The president feels strongly we need to get a budget approved,"" the source said, adding: ""that presupposes having a government that can last until at least December."" However, the source said elections could not be ruled out in September or October if no other solution was found. A short-term government could only take office with the support of either 5-Star or the League, and both parties, to varying degrees, have been hostile to the idea. ""At this point for me there is no other solution. We have to go back to the polls as soon as possible,"" Di Maio said on Monday after the prospect of a deal with the PD dwindled due to staunch opposition from its former leader Matteo Renzi. 5-Star originally pinned its hopes on hooking up with League leader Matteo Salvini, but it insisted he should first abandon his old ally, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who it views as a symbol of political corruption.  Salvini has so far refused. In a sign of growing friction, Di Maio accused Salvini on Wednesday of going back on a previous pledge to ditch Berlusconi, suggesting he was only standing by him because he needed funding from the billionaire businessmen. Salvini rejected this: ""I am not going to reply to insults about money ... for us loyalty and consistency are worth more than becoming ministers."" The PD, which has governed since 2013 but was trounced at the March ballot, is due to meet on Thursday to decide whether to open government negotiations with 5-Star. Renzi, who still wields strong influence over his group, has come out against any deal, exacerbating long-running party tensions between those who want to talk to 5-Star and those who don't and reviving speculation the PD might split apart. The PD's interim leader Maurizio Martina on Wednesday told Renzi supporters to shutter a new website that ruled out any possible dealings between the two parties. ""Have we come to this? ... There is a limit that should never be crossed,"" Martina wrote.  (Writing by Crispian Balmer; editing by John Stonestreet)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
74,2018-05-02,Teacher Pay Is So Low in Some U.S. School Districts That They’re Recruiting Overseas,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/arizona-teachers-philippines.html,2539," By Dana Goldstein GLENDALE, Ariz. — The latest wave of foreign workers sweeping into American jobs brought Donato Soberano from the Philippines to Arizona two years ago. He had to pay thousands of dollars to a job broker and lived for a time in an apartment with five other Filipino workers. The lure is the pay — 10 times more than what he made doing the same work back home. But Mr. Soberano is not a hospitality worker or a home health aide. He is in another line of work that increasingly pays too little to attract enough Americans: Mr. Soberano is a public school teacher. As walkouts by teachers protesting low pay and education funding shortfalls spread across the country, the small but growing movement to recruit teachers from overseas is another sign of the difficulty some districts are having providing the basics to public school students. Among the latest states hit by the protests is Arizona, where teacher pay is more than $10,000 below the national average of $59,000 per year. The Pendergast Elementary School District, where Mr. Soberano works, has recruited more than 50 teachers from the Philippines since 2015. They hold J-1 visas, which allow them to work temporarily in the United States, like au pairs or camp counselors, but offer no path to citizenship. More than 2,800 foreign teachers arrived on American soil last year through the J-1, according to the State Department, up from about 1,200 in 2010. “In these times, you have to be innovative and creative in recruiting,” said Patricia Davis-Tussey, Pendergast’s head of human resources. “We embrace diversity and really gain a lot from the cultural exchange experience. Our students do as well.” The district, which covers parts of Glendale, Avondale and north Phoenix, is a hotbed of activism in the teacher walkout movement, known as #RedforEd. Picketing educators say they have had to move in with their parents, apply for food stamps and pay out of pocket for classroom essentials like graph paper and science supplies. They argue that taxes are too low to adequately fund schools, or for teachers to secure a middle-class lifestyle. In response to the teacher walkout, Republican lawmakers introduced a budget that provides new funding for salaries and classrooms. But leaders of the #RedForEd movement said the bill fell far short of their demands, and would restore only about a quarter of the $1.1 billion in annual cuts that they say schools have weathered since the last recession. [Read: Teacher strikes are illegal in many of the walkout states. That hasn’t stopped educators.] In Pendergast, where salaries of around $40,000 are a source of pain and protest for the district’s American educators, Mr. Soberano is thankful for the pay. Much like other foreign workers, he went into debt to find a job in the United States. He said he used savings and a bank loan to pay $12,500, about three years’ worth of his salary in the Philippines, to Petro-Fil Manpower Services. That is a Filipino company of Ligaya Avenida, a California-based consultant who recruits and screens teachers for the J-1. The payment covered Mr. Soberano’s airfare and rent for his first few months in Arizona, as well as a $2,500 fee for Ms. Avenida and a fee of several thousand dollars to Alliance Abroad Group, a Texas-based company that is an official State Department sponsor for J-1 visa holders. The J-1 lasts three years, with the option for two one-year extensions. For each year he works in the United States, Mr. Soberano will owe Alliance Abroad an additional $1,000 visa renewal fee. “You have to make some sacrifices to leave your family way back home,” Mr. Soberano said. Every night, he prepares lessons for his seventh- and eighth-grade science students, and every morning, he wakes up at 4 a.m. to video chat with his wife and two teenage daughters, who are ending their day in Manila. Despite their separation, he said the experience has been rewarding, “teaching in a different culture, but also, financially.” The school districts that recruit teachers like Mr. Soberano say that they have few other options, because they can’t find enough American educators willing to work for the pay that’s offered. They say that the foreign teachers are being given valuable opportunities, and that American students are enriched by learning from them. But critics argue the teachers are being taken advantage of in a practice that helps keep wages low and perpetuates yearslong austerity policies. [Read: Why are teachers walking out? What’s the difference between a walkout and a strike?] Though J-1 teachers account for only a tiny share of Arizona’s 60,000 public schoolteachers, international recruitment has spread quickly in recent years, as sponsor companies market themselves to districts facing shortages and word spreads among administrators. According to the State Department, 183 Arizona teachers were granted new J-1 visas last year, up from 17 in 2010. “Rather than increase salaries, districts may once again resort to recruiting internationally as a way to solve the teacher shortage,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers’ union, said in a statement. She added that while her union “will fight for everyone working in our communities and educating our kids to have fair wages, rights and workplace protections regardless of where they’re from, the use of the J-1 visa program to fill long-term shortages is an abuse of an exchange program.” Administrators and researchers say experienced foreign educators can be a better option for students than the substitutes who would otherwise fill these positions. But research is clear that teacher churn negatively impacts academic achievement. J-1 teachers are, because of the visa’s limitations, temporary; and without higher pay and regular raises, administrators in these districts say it will be impossible to attract enough American teachers and keep them in the classroom. During the recession, districts found it easier to hire American workers, since more of them were looking to teach. But as the economy picked back up, hiring became difficult in states like Arizona, which have pursued years of tax cuts that have dampened school budgets and teacher pay. The Pendergast district has lost $1.6 million over the past five years because of state and local cuts, according to administrators. The superintendent, Lily Matos DeBlieux, has sought private donations to fund a Spanish-English dual-language program, a monthly lunch discussion to help parents navigate their children’s education and many other efforts. “With the little we have, we have done an incredible job,” she said. But hiring remains a challenge. Even with 48 J-1 visa-holders teaching this year, Pendergast has still had to rely on 20 long-term substitutes, said Ms. Davis-Tussey, the chief of human resources. In addition to interviewing international candidates via Skype, district staff members have traveled to Manila several times since 2015 to interview teachers. Mr. Soberano met with the district there in June 2016, and just two months later, arrived in Arizona to teach at Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Glendale. The Philippines was the top sender of J-1 teachers to the United States in 2017, followed by Jamaica and China. The 15,000-mile round-trips made sense, Ms. Davis-Tussey said. Many short-staffed schools turn to Teach for America, which recruits recent college graduates and career-changers for two-year stints in the classroom. But to hire a Teach for America recruit, who may have no teaching experience or coursework in education, the district must pay $5,000 per teacher, in addition to salaries. For a similar amount, a single trip to the Philippines can net dozens of candidates, all of whom, as required by the J-1 program, have degrees in education or the subjects they teach, and at least two years of experience in a Filipino school. Mr. Soberano holds one bachelor’s degree in education, with a focus on physics, and another in philosophy. He has also studied theology. He has over 20 years of classroom experience. Mukul Bakhshi, director of the Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices, in Philadelphia, said the Philippines purposefully trains teachers, nurses and other workers “in a way that it’s easy for them to pass muster from licensing authorities here. They obviously speak English, and they are willing to work.” Remittances from foreign workers account for about 10 percent of the Philippines’ gross domestic product. The Pendergast district did not owe any money to the companies that connected it with recruits in Manila. Those costs were borne by the Filipino teachers. James Bell, president of Alliance Abroad, the visa sponsor, said a financial arrangement like Mr. Soberano’s is just one of several models the company uses, and that in some cases, school districts pay visa3,5 renewal fees. Alliance Abroad sponsors several hundred J-1 visa holders each year, according to Mr. Bell, working primarily in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. He said the biggest demand was for special-education teachers, though districts also looked to hire in science, math and foreign languages. In Gila Bend, a small town 70 miles southwest of Phoenix, 11 Filipino teachers who room together in several shared apartments commute to work by van 100 miles round-trip each day, according to Peggy Perry, a secretary in the district’s central office. In Casa Grande, halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, about 25 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas are teaching science, math, special education and English, said Mary Ann Amerson, head of human resources for the Casa Grande Union High School District. The district works with Ms. Avenida, the California-based consultant, to find the teachers and interview them via Skype. “We don’t pay any money for it,” Ms. Amerson said. The recruits pay the fees. Ms. Avenida said her company, which uses the name Avenida International Consultants in the United States, recruited 250 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas in 2017. According to State Department data, that would account for more than half the total number of J-1 visa holders who arrived from the Philippines last year. Ms. Avenida joined union representatives in a working group, assembled by the Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices, that drafted a 2015 code of conduct for international teacher recruitment. The code calls for districts to bear all recruitment and legal costs, and for foreign educators not to be charged more than a nominal application processing fee, under $150. It has not been widely adopted, and Ms. Avenida said she disagreed with the group’s conclusions. “Somebody has to foot the bill,” she said — and in a climate of tight school budgets, that somebody is the teacher. [Read: How will the protests against education cuts affect the midterm elections?] In Mr. Soberano’s case, it was not until his second year on the job that he had paid back the money he owed and was able to begin sending some home to his family. He has had to live austerely. In his first year in Arizona, he shared an apartment with five other Filipino teachers, and he now rents a room in the home of a Filipino-American family. Still, he said he was nothing but grateful for the opportunity. “The district is very supportive,” he said. Pendergast created a welcome committee to assist the Filipino teachers, and colleagues pitched in by buying groceries and driving the newcomers to work. In addition to financial challenges, foreign educators face instructional ones. Administrators across the country who work with J-1 visa holders say the teachers must learn the federal requirement for inclusion, which requires that disabled children be taught alongside nondisabled peers, in the least restrictive environment possible. And classroom management techniques differ across cultures. “In the Philippines, the teacher there is really an authority figure,” Mr. Soberano said. “Once I stood in front of the class, everybody kept quiet.” That wasn’t the case in Arizona. “One thing I also learned is to be friends with the students,” Mr. Soberano added, “to know more about each one and especially their family. How are they doing? When you understand them, I remove that kind of problem.” State Department regulations require J-1 teachers to engage in cultural exchange activities with their students. The J-1 program was created by the 1961 Fulbright-Hayes Act, with the purpose of fostering understanding between nations. Mr. Soberano said that once a month, he teaches a lesson on Filipino culture, and that his students have been most interested in discussing the differences between the Filipino and American education systems. In the Philippines, Mr. Soberano tells them, school is stricter and more academically challenging. New regulations from the State Department, which went into effect in 2016, require J-1 holders to return to their home countries for at least two years after their visas expire before reapplying. Mr. Soberano said he may do that. But his wish is to reside legally in the United States and work long-term as a teacher. “I would love to bring my family here,” he said. Ms. Weingarten, the union president, suggested that the H-1B visa for high-skilled immigrants, which offers a pathway toward permanent residence, would be a more appropriate visa for a teacher like Mr. Soberano. But Pendergast and other school districts say long wait times and high legal costs can make the H-1B prohibitive. The Trump administration has also tightened oversight of that program. In Denver public schools, 20 bilingual education teachers hold H-1Bs and about three hold J-1s. But in the future, the district said, it may expand its use of the J-1. “We still don’t have enough people to fill the openings,” said Bart Muller, the managing director of employee and labor relations for the system. “The political environment has been a little challenging over the last year and a half. The bottom line is there are a lot more hoops to jump through with H-1B, while J-1 is fairly simple. You can do it expeditiously.” Lora Bartlett, an education professor who has written a book about migrant teachers, argued that there should be a new visa category that meets the needs of public schools while allowing effective teachers to achieve legal residency. But, she added, “there are people who have a vested interest in not finding a long-term solution. There is a whole industry that makes money every time a new teacher comes into the country. They don’t make money when a teacher stays.” [Read:  How our reporter came across this story.] And in Arizona, where many teachers are expected to improve test scores using aging textbooks inside buildings in need of repair, districts worry that a modest increase in teacher salaries and school funding won’t be enough to persuade more local candidates to enter the profession. “Quite frankly, for a lot of the teachers, some of the fun and creativity has been taken out of it with mandates,” said Ms. Amerson, the head of human resources in Casa Grande. “It seems like we spend the whole entire second semester testing kids.” In Pendergast, Ms. Davis-Tussey agreed that higher pay alone would not be enough to fill the empty jobs that have forced her to look to the Philippines. “That respect for the profession is just as important as the money,” she said. “And for a long time, teachers have felt, not only did they not have money, but what they were doing was being brushed aside and not respected.”       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
75,2018-05-02,Exclusive: UTC Set to Win EU Approval for $23 Billion Rockwell Collins Deal-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-rockwell-collins-m-a-utc-eu-exclusive.html,307," By Reuters BRUSSELS — U.S. aerospace and industrial company United Technologies Corp is set to win EU approval for the largest aerospace deal in history, a $23 billion bid for avionics maker Rockwell Collins, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The deal, announced in September last year, would create a new player in the top echelon of suppliers to Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier and other plane makers. The takeover would give UTC, maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, more leverage to resist pressure from plane makers seeking price cuts. Rockwell Collins' software capability would also give UTC an edge in data crunching that allows airlines to spot problems in engines and other components before they fail. UTC has offered to sell assets to address the European Commission's concerns, the people said, declining to provide details. Analysts had said the deal could face a bumpier road in the EU than in the United States because of the merged company's size and market power. The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 4, and UTC declined to comment. UTC cleared a hurdle last month after key client Boeing said it had provided consent to the deal after raising initial concerns. Analysts said the combined company could make more than 50 percent of the systems content on a Boeing 787 aircraft by dollar value. A source close to Airbus had told Reuters it had concerns about the merger. Problems at Pratt & Whitney have delayed European aircraft deliveries, and Airbus has publicly warned UTC to focus on delivering jet engines on time. Rockwell Collins' businesses are in avionics, seats and plane interiors. This is the second engines-to-seating supplier deal after French jet engine maker Safran acquired seat maker Zodiac Aerospace last year.

76,2018-05-02,Germany's Spending Plans Likely to Disappoint at Home and Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-germany-budget.html,690," By Reuters BERLIN — Social Democratic German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz presented spending plans on Wednesday that see public investment falling from 2020 and advised ministries demanding more funds to live within their means. His package may disappoint U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called on Germany and other European allies to increase the percentage of their GDP devoted to defence spending to pull their weight in the U.S.-led NATO alliance. Germany's fellow euro zone members are unlikely to welcome the spending blueprint either, as they had hoped the Social Democrats, part of Germany's governing coalition, would steer the EU's economic powerhouse away from austerity. Germany's defence and development ministries, for their part, have objected in writing to the budget plan, saying it violates the coalition pact signed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democratic (SPD) junior partner. Presenting the budget plans that foresee no net new debt through to 2022, Scholz said: ""I am convinced: in good economic times, a responsible fiscal policy must achieve both a reduction in debts and a rise in investments."" Scholz's remarks echoed those of his conservative predecessor Wolfgang Schaeuble, who insisted that euro zone partners abide to budget rules through austerity. Under the spending plans, investment would rise from 34.0 billion euros (30 billion pounds) in 2017 to 37.0 billion this year and 37.9 billion next, before decreasing in 2020 and hitting 33.5 billion in 2022. ""All the ministries who have plans must do so within the possibilities available in our country, and we wrote into our constitution (in 2011) that we want to pursue policies that allow the states no new debt from 2020 and for the federal government only a very small amount of new debt,"" Scholz said. Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and Development Minister Gerd Mueller - both conservatives - met Merkel last week to demand more funds for their ministries. They said the budget plan, as submitted by Scholz, flouted pledges to ensure that Germany's development aid and defence spending as a percentage of economic output did not shrink. The two ministries are seeking improvements before the cabinet debates a fuller 2019 budget on July 4. Germany has had a ""debt brake"" law in place since 2011 that forces the federal and state governments to virtually eliminate their structural budget deficits over the next five to 10 years. The German economy is growing for the ninth year in a row and the government has kept a balance budget since 2014. ""INTERNATIONAL CRISES"" Mueller told reporters it was the federal government's job to ""strengthen Germany's role in the world"" and both ministries needed more money to meet their international obligations. ""International crises are increasing in which the Bundeswehr (German army) and (the development ministry) are needed,"" he said, citing Yemen, Iraq and the plight of the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. A defence ministry source said defence spending as a percentage of economic output would rise to 1.3 percent in 2019, as Merkel had assured Trump last week, but would fall thereafter unless budget plans were adjusted. Asked how much the pressure from Trump influenced Germany's defence spending plans, Scholz told reporters: ""Not at all."" The source told reporters that defence spending would fall to 1.23 percent in 2022, even below the projected level for 2018, despite Germany's pledge as a member of NATO to steadily increase its military budget towards a target of 2 percent. The defence ministry would also have to delay some major procurement programmes planned with other countries unless more funds are added in coming months, although it was not yet clear which projects could be affected, the source said. In total, the source said, the defence ministry got only 20 percent of the 12 billion euros in funding it requested for 2019 through 2021, excluding personnel costs to be covered by the finance ministry. Germany's development aid, now at around 0.5 percent of GDP, would drop to 0.47 percent in 2019, and more in coming years, a development ministry source said. To meet its obligation, the development ministry would need around 1.1 billion euros in extra funding, the source said.  (Editing by Mark Heinrich)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
77,2018-05-02,The Ninth Annual New York Times Summer Reading Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/learning/the-ninth-annual-new-york-times-summer-reading-contest.html,1641," Contests By Katherine Schulten Every year since 2010 we have invited teenagers around the world to add The New York Times to their summer reading lists, and, so far, over 30,000 have. At a time when breaking-news alerts are as constant as concerns about “fake news,” teachers and students alike may feel that keeping up with a reliable source of information is more important than ever. We hope our 10-week contest can make that easy. But we also hope students will realize that reading The Times is fun. As you’ll see in the guidelines below, literally anything published on NYTimes.com in 2018 is fair game. We don’t care if you choose a piece about politics or polar bears, baseball or “Black Panther,” food, fashion, Fortnite or Flyball; we just care about why you chose it. Interested? The contest runs from June 15 to Aug. 24, and all the details are below. In a nutshell, though: Every Friday we ask students, “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” You then have until the following Friday to answer, when a team of Times journalists choose their favorite responses, and we publish them here. Post any questions you might have in the comments or write us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. You can also watch our webinar on summer and independent reading to learn more. __________ Here’s how it works: • The contest runs from June 15 to Aug. 24. • Every Friday beginning June 15, we will publish a post asking the same two questions: What interested you most in The Times this week? Why? You can always find that link in an update at the top of this page. It will also appear in this column. • Anyone 13 to 19 years old from anywhere in the world can post an answer any week until Friday, Aug. 24, and contestants can choose from any Times article, essay, video, interactive or photograph published in 2018, on any topic they like. • Every Tuesday starting July 3 we will announce winners from a previous week and publish their writing. • To get an idea of the breadth of topics students have chosen in the past — from refugees and “post-truth politics” to power napping and junk food — you can read the work of our 2017 winners here, and our 2010-2016 winners here. • Scroll down to find more details and tips, the most important of which are also on this handy PDF. • More questions? Here are some that have been frequently asked over the years, but please post anything else you’d like to know in the comments, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com, and we’ll answer you there. Q. What kinds of responses are you looking for? A. We don’t care what you choose or whether you loved or hated it; what we care about is what you have to say about why you picked it. If you don’t believe us, scroll through our 2017 winners, or, via our old blog, view the work of winners from 2010 to 2016. They have written on weighty topics like gender, race and identity, space exploration and 21st-century concentration camps, but they have also written on Beyoncé, Disney shows, bagels, running and Jon Stewart withdrawal. Whatever the subject, you’ll see that the best pieces year after year make both personal connections to the news and go beyond the personal to discuss the broader questions and ideas that the topic raises. So whether you were moved by an article, enlightened by an essay, bowled over by a photo, irked by an editorial or inspired by a video, find something in The Times that genuinely interests you and tell us why, as honestly and originally as you can. Q. What are the rules? A. First, here is a PDF of the key rules and details in this post. Please share. — We will post the same questions every Friday, starting June 15. Each week we will ask, “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” That is where you should post your picks (and reasons) any time until the next Friday. Then we will close that post to comments and open a new one with the same questions. That means that students can write in on any day until Friday, Aug. 24, at 7 a.m. Eastern when the contest ends. As soon as the contest starts, we will keep an up-to-date link to that week’s question at the top of this page. — You can choose from anything published in the print paper or on NYTimes.com in 2018, including videos, graphics, slide shows and podcasts. — Feel free to participate every week, but we allow only one submission per person per week. — The contest is open to teenagers only — anyone from 13 to 19 years old — from anywhere in the world. — Our commenting system allows responses up to 1,500 characters, which is somewhere between 250 and 300 words. — Make sure to provide us with the full URL or headline (for example, “Review: ‘Harry Potter and the Cursed Child’ Raises the Bar for Broadway Magic” or https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/theater/review-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-raises-the-bar-for-broadway-magic.html). Q. Who will be judging my work? A. The Learning Network staff, plus a team of as-yet-to-be-named New York Times journalists. Q. When should I check to see whether my submission won? A. Every Tuesday from July 3 to Sept. 4, we will publish a previous week’s winner or winners in a separate article you can find here. We will also celebrate the winners on Twitter and Facebook. Q. How do I participate in this contest if I don’t have a digital subscription? A. NYTimes.com has a digital subscription system in which readers have free access to five articles each month. If you exceed that limit, you will be asked to become a digital subscriber. One thing you should know, however, is that all Learning Network posts for students, as well as all Times articles linked from them, are accessible without a digital subscription. That means that if you use any of the articles we have linked to on our site for summer reading, they will not count as part of the five-article limit. And remember: You can use anything published in 2018. Q. How do I prove to my teacher that I participated? A. When you comment, make sure to check the box that asks if you would like to be emailed when your comment is published. If you do so, the system will send you a link to your comment, which you can use to show your teacher, your parents, your friends or anyone else you’d like to impress. Please note that you will not get an email until the comment has been approved, which may take up to 48 hours over weekends. Another method? Some teachers ask students to take screenshots of their comments before they hit “submit,” then gather those all together at the end of the summer. Q. How can teachers, librarians and parents use this challenge? A. Through the years, adults have told us over and over that participating in this contest has made their students both more aware of and more interested in what’s going on in the world. Many see it as a low-stakes way to help teenagers start building a news-reading habit. If that’s not enough of a reason to assign it, our contest is also an easy way to add more nonfiction to your students’ reading lists — and to encourage teenagers to make their own choices about what to read, as anything published in The Times in 2018 is fair game. Participating also meets the recommendations given in this joint statement on independent reading given by the International Reading Association, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the Canadian Children’s Book Centre. But maybe the most compelling reason to assign this contest is what students themselves say about it. Reflecting on participating in 2017, a teenager named Emma Weber, from London, echoed what many have told us over the years: What interested me this week in the Times? There was a lot to reflect on, as usual: Barcelona, Charlottesville, and, on a more cheerful note, the solar eclipse. Despite the plethora of options, I am writing about the Summer Reading Contest itself and how it has interested, and transformed, me over the past ten weeks. Prior to this summer, the only writing I did was for school assignments or Google searches. And if I did get around to it, I never reread what I wrote. That’s why, as the weeks went on, I surprised myself when I began double and triple checking my comments for mistakes, of which there were far more than expected! Another transformation is my newfound interest in the news. I used to be the kind of person who opened a newspaper and went straight to the puzzles section, and though that may be unchanged, I now feel compelled to read a few articles that catch my eye too. In return, exposing myself to current affairs has fine-tuned my political opinions, and through consistent writing I learned to express them in a way that accentuates them. The result? I feel grounded in my views and understand what’s going on in the world. It’s amazing what a change 1,500 characters a week make. Thank you for making this contest a hit year after year, and please spread the word that it’s back for a ninth season. Good luck! __________ Questions? Please write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com. We will add the link to the top of this post on June 16, when the contest begins. And if you watch our webinar, you’ll get many more tips, including ideas for practicing in class before you send students away for summer break, and ideas for keeping their independent news-reading habits alive back in the classroom this fall.

78,2018-05-02,Islamic State Claims Responsibility for Gun Attack North of Baghdad,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/world/middleeast/02reuters-mideast-crisis-iraq-attacks-islamic-state.html,144," By Reuters BAGHDAD — Islamic State claimed responsibility on Wednesday for a deadly gun attack near the Iraqi town of Tarmiya. A security source had told Reuters that militants killed eight unarmed civilians in the assault 25 km (15 miles) north of Baghdad on Tuesday. Islamic State said it killed 22 people, describing them all as members of a government-backed Sunni Muslim tribal force called the Tribal Mobilisation Forces. ""Clashes with light and medium weapons took place and led to the death of 22 apostates and the wounding of 10 others,"" the Sunni militant group said in a statement. Iraq declared victory in December over Islamic State, which had seized control of nearly a third of the country in 2014. But the group continues to carry out attacks and bombings in Baghdad and other parts of the country.  (Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein; Editing by Andrew Heavens)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
79,2018-05-02,New Dawn or Swan Song? Czech Communists Eye Slice of Power After Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/world/europe/02reuters-czech-politics-communists.html,837," By Reuters PRAGUE — When the United States, Britain and France bombed Syria earlier this month, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis showed support for his Western partners one day before rowing back the next. The military strike turned from ""inevitable"" to an act described as changing nothing after Babis was rebuked by the far-left Communist party, showing the fine line the billionaire businessman is walking as he tries to form a government. Babis is aiming for a pro-Western administration but political fragmentation in October's election means he needs the pro-Russian Communist party to either support it or abstain, ending the party's pariah status since communism fell in 1989. The Communists and President Milos Zeman will push Babis -- whose ANO party is pro-EU and pro-NATO -- toward a softer tone on Moscow, but he is not expected to move far despite the fall of his first minority cabinet in a confidence vote in January. Shunned by most parties over charges of fraud in a 2 million euro EU subsidy case he says is a plot, Babis is now negotiating a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats that would also lean on Communist votes. The Communists' limited role, with no cabinet seats, would not bring the kind of changes to core policies that have sparked conflict between the EU and Hungary and Poland, but would still anger many Czechs who suffered under their rule. The current Communist rank and file, with average age well over 70, are nostalgic about life behind the Iron Curtain, and the party pledges to fight global capitalism and leave NATO. ""Security threats do not come from the east, security is under threat from those who commit aggressive attacks against sovereign countries in violation of international law as the United States, Britain and France have done in Syria,"" party leader Vojtech Filip said at a party congress on April 21. FOREIGN POLICY The Communists would like to end EU sanctions on Russia and follow Moscow's line on Ukraine: party officials have traveled to separatist-controlled Donbass and Crimea. They oppose Czech participation in military missions lacking UN approval -- which means any opposed by Russia as permanent UN Security Council member. The Czechs have hundreds of troops in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, a number Babis's cabinet aims to boost this year by several hundred. The Czechs also plan to help protect NATO airspace in the Baltic. ""We have an elevated sensitivity to any pressure for escalation of tensions toward the post-Soviet region, we would have to react very strongly to anything like that,"" Communist member of parliament Jiri Dolejs told Reuters. The Communists also criticized Babis's government for handing a suspected Russian hacker in March to the United States, and for expelling Russian diplomats after the attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. FALLING SUPPORT It is unclear what concessions the Communists would secure from the two coalition parties, but their influence will be limited by their waning popularity. They scored their worst post-Communist election result, 7.8 percent, in October, bleeding half of their votes to the far-right and to Babis. ""They have become very pragmatic over the last two decades,"" said Lubomir Kopecek, political science professor at the Masaryk University. ""The request to leave NATO does not appear in the talks...A large part of the party's elite wants to experience some recognition at the end of their political careers."" A senior source from one of the negotiating parties said the Communists would be satisfied with positions in administration and state-owned firms. In foreign policy, the government could seek support elsewhere in parliament. Dolejs said the party wanted to have a say on issues such as social benefits. ""Tolerating the government will raise our legitimacy. We see a chance to show our voters... that we can get at least a bird in the hand."" MORE TROUBLE ELSEWHERE? Involving the Communists is not a sudden turnaround. They have been part of regional governments and former party members, who include Babis himself, have held prominent jobs. For the center-right, the party remains a no-go. ""Andrej Babis is fulfilling his dream at too high a cost,"" Petr Fiala, leader of the Civic Democrats, said in a post last week. But elsewhere views are finely balanced. A Median agency survey last month showed 45 percent of Czechs could accept a Communist-backed government, while another 41 percent reject it. Thousands protested in March after Zdenek Ondracek, a Communist lawmaker who had been in a police unit that beat up pro-democracy protesters in the 1980s, was elected to lead a police inspection oversight body. Babis withdrew his support and Ondracek resigned. Within the Social Democrats, there is more debate about the risks of joining Babis, due to his legal problems and visions of streamlining political decision-making, than the Communists. And Social Democrat leader Jan Hamacek said on Saturday he was more worried about the rising far-right, anti-Islam, anti-NATO and anti-EU party SPD, which won 10.6 percent of the vote.

80,2018-05-02,Exclusive: UPS Weighs Strategy to Deliver Bulky Goods to Boost Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-ups-delivery-expansion-exclsuive.html,981," By Reuters (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is in talks with at least one U.S. trucking firm to launch an in-home delivery service for large, heavy goods such as couches and treadmills, as the world's largest package deliverer looks to cash in on one the fastest growing segments of online retail. UPS and its rival FedEx Corp currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds (68.04 kg) in weight to a person's door step, and neither carries packages into a person's home or handles so-called ""white glove"" services such as product assembly or installation. UPS told Reuters it is now eyeing the furniture delivery business - one of the fastest-growing segments of online retail - with Amazon.com Inc, Wayfair Inc and other e-commerce companies competing for market share against chains like Crate and Barrel and big-box stores. A source familiar with the matter said UPS is in talks to hire trucking company Werner Enterprises to help it compete in this area, potentially by the end of the year. Werner launched its “final-mile” service in 2016, and has been building it out over the last year. Details of a potential partnership remain unclear given the early stages of the discussions, the source added.  Werner declined to comment on the matter, and UPS would not identify who it is in talks with. Final-mile delivery is a market that Transport Futures economist Noel Perry said could grow to about $12 billion over the next decade, from about $3.7 billion today, thanks in large part to a growing appetite from younger consumers to buy everything from BBQ grills and mattresses to dining room tables online. “Outsourcing to a trucking firm would allow UPS to enter into the final-mile business without committing its own capital up front to expand its fleet or acquire end-of-line, final-mile infrastructure such as terminals,” R.W. Baird analyst Ben Hartford said.  That could be welcome news to UPS investors waiting on Chief Executive David Abney's promise to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions.  When asked about the strategy with bulky goods in an interview with Reuters, UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber said the company has decided it can't ignore the rising demand for in-home deliveries of furniture, mattresses, and treadmills, and was evaluating different ways to handle the larger cargo. “You got bigger products moving through networks across the globe,” said Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber. “What we have to do is try and figure out the right way to get them in the right network as we move forward.” Barber did not confirm talks with any specific company, and said that UPS has not made a final decision “because you have to balance it with our Express network, our labor constraints and our strategy going forward.”  Other trucking players include Schneider National, Ryder System Inc, Seko Logistics, and J.B. Hunt, which have expanded final-mile capabilities organically or through partnerships and acquisitions in recent years, hoping to lure major retailers with their scale. Schneider and XPO Logistics, the largest provider of final-mile bulky deliveries in North America, told Reuters they had not met with UPS to discuss handling final-mile deliveries. J.B. Hunt and Ryder declined to comment. Seko did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As it is now, most of the major trucking and logistics firms in this final-mile bulky goods business hire regional contract-carriers – and there are hundreds nationwide – to haul products from warehouses to living rooms across the country. If UPS moves forward, it would give UPS’ retail customers including Wayfair, Amazon.com, Walmart Inc, IKEA AB and Target Corp a ""big and heavy option"" in their online shipping portals so consumers can receive shipments across the country, the source said.  It could also set up UPS to hit its goal of being a one-stop shipping partner for retailers while also solving the problem of sofa-sized boxes unexpectedly showing up in trailers they pick up from retailer warehouses and take to parcel sorting hubs.  UPS has worked for years to limit the sizes of unwieldy - or “non-conveyable” - items as it invests to speed up its package-sorting operation. It charges big premiums to handle the freight.  UPS main rival FedEx said in March the expansion of its Memphis hub will include an area for oversized shipments and announced it bought UK-based deliverer P2P Mailing Limited. But a company spokesman said FedEx does not yet do in-home heavy goods deliveries in the United States. BULKY RISKS Entering the bulk goods delivery business adds new complexities and risks compared to traditional parcel delivery. For example, hauling a dresser to an upstairs bedroom and assembling it is a more intricate and physically demanding affair than dropping off a pallet at a warehouse's loading dock. XPO Logistics’ Chief Information Officer Mario Harik said in an interview it was training drivers on etiquette and how to use mobile devices to log deliveries and customer complaints for large or heavy deliveries.  Truckers can charge more for ""white glove"" services - which include varying degrees of installation, product assembly, and repairs - but the margins are often no better than other types of deliveries because stiff competition for new business has held down the prices carriers can charge retailers.  But deliverers are hoping they can hike prices and boost margins as they increase delivery “density,” or the number of deliveries they make in a region on a given day, said Hartford, the R.W. Baird analyst.  Heavy goods deliveries through UPS would likely include two workers willing to spend 20 minutes in a home, versus more complex installation and repairs, the source said. UPS declined to discuss the growth potential, but the source familiar with the strategy said UPS was looking initially for a trucking partner that could make or manage as many as “tens of thousands” of deliveries daily.

82,2018-05-02,"Mo Salah of Liverpool Breaks Down Cultural Barriers, One Goal at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/mo-salah-liverpool-champions-league.html,1673," LIVERPOOL, England — Mohamed Salah’s routine is familiar now. As the Liverpool Football Club stadium erupts joyously around him, celebrating yet another of the Egyptian’s goals, he runs to the fans closest to him, arms outstretched. He stands stock still, soaking in the adulation. Once his teammates have congratulated him, he walks slowly back to the center circle. “Then there is this pause,” said Neil Atkinson, host of The Anfield Wrap, a Liverpool fans’ podcast, and a regular at the stadium. Mr. Salah raises his hands to the sky and then kneels on the field, prostrating himself in a deeply personal demonstration of his Muslim faith. “The crowd goes a little quieter, allows him that moment of reflection,” Mr. Atkinson said. There is another roar as he stands up, “and then everyone celebrates again.” Mr. Salah has been European soccer’s breakout star this season. He has scored 43 goals in 49 games in his first season at Liverpool. He has carried the team to its first Champions League final in more than a decade. He has been voted England’s player of the year both by his fellow players and by the Football Writers’ Association. His faith — and his public displays of it — have also made him a figure of considerable social and cultural significance. At a time when Britain is fighting rising Islamophobia, when government policy has been to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants, he is a North African and a Muslim who is not just accepted in Britain, but adored. “He is someone who embodies Islam’s values and wears his faith on his sleeve,” said Miqdaad Versi, the assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain. “He has a likability. He is the hero of the team. Liverpool, in particular, has rallied around him in a really positive way. He is not the solution to Islamophobia, but he can play a major role.” Mr. Salah, 25, is used to being an icon. In Egypt, his status as a national treasure was confirmed in October last year, when his nerveless last-minute penalty kick secured the country’s national team a place in this summer’s World Cup, its first appearance at the tournament since 1990. Mr. Salah, grinning deliriously, was carried around the stadium in the Egyptian city of Alexandria on fans’ shoulders. His face adorns countless walls in Cairo. A mural of him outside a cafe in downtown Cairo has become a tourist attraction. The city’s markets offer his image on everything from bed linen to lanterns, traditionally given as a gift during Ramadan. In March, it was reported that he had garnered considerable support in the country’s presidential election, despite not running as a candidate. The Premier League, and European soccer in general, has always been popular in Egypt, but now thousands pack Cairo’s coffee shops and shisha bars to watch Liverpool’s games. “No Egyptian has done what Mohamed has done, which is why his rise is so important to the public,” said Ahmed Atta, an Egyptian soccer analyst. “Everyone is watching the Premier League now. Social media is awash with pictures of him.” Mr. Salah’s popularity is not just the result of his prowess on the field; just as important is his philanthropy. “He is constantly donating money to charities and to his hometown,” said Said Elshishiny, the coach who discovered his talent as a child in Nagrig, a town in the Nile Delta. “It is enough to make anyone adore him.” Mr. Salah has donated a dialysis machine to a hospital in Nagrig, paid for land to build a sewage treatment plant and renovated a public sports center, a school and a mosque. He has given money to an investment fund set up to bolster Egypt’s faltering economy, and in April, he took part in a video supporting a government campaign against drug addiction. Within three days of its release, it produced a fourfold increase in the number of people seeking treatment, according to the Egyptian Ministry of Social Solidarity. That he sees no need to disguise his faith only fuels his popularity. “People love the fact that he is not scared of kneeling in prayer in front of everyone in a non-Muslim country at a time of rising Islamophobia,” Mr. Atta said. “It is like a victory to them.” It feels the same way to the Muslim community — drawn largely from Syrian, Yemeni and Bangladeshi backgrounds — on Merseyside, the region that includes Liverpool. “Muslims are under pressure” in Britain, said Abu Usamah Atthababi, imam of Al Masra mosque in Toxteth, an inner-city district of Liverpool. In recent years, police figures suggest that hate crimes toward Muslims have been rising across the country, with spikes in religiously motivated hate crimes after terror attacks in and around Paris in 2015, in London in 2016 and 2017, and in Manchester, England, in 2017. A report by the charity Tell MAMA last year suggested that Islamophobic attacks rose by 47 percent in 2016. “There is not only evidence that it is on the rise,” said Mr. Versi, “but it is becoming more normalized: It is becoming acceptable to express Islamophobic sentiments in mainstream circles.” The toxicity of the dialogue around Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, as well as the virulent anti-immigrant stance of the right-wing news media, Mr. Versi said, contributed to an environment in which “people are more comfortable expressing bigoted views.” Liverpool has seen problems, too. The city considers itself more welcoming than many places in Britain: a “city of outsiders, an anti-establishment city,” as Mr. Atkinson put it. Liverpool has not always enjoyed the easiest of relationships with the rest of the country, he said, adding that “it maybe knows more than most what it is to be tarred as ‘other.’ ” That is one reason that Radwan Albarbandi, a doctor who moved to Britain from Syria a decade ago and who has lived in Liverpool since 2010, says he believes that most Muslims feel “safe and comfortable here.” It is home to one of England’s oldest Muslim communities, and was the site of the country’s first mosque. Mr. Atthababi, the imam, pointed out that the city “has a long history of diversity and celebrating that diversity.” He noted that many in the city still refuse to read The Sun, the newspaper boycotted by Liverpool fans since 1989 for its coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 of the club’s supporters died. “It is a left-leaning place,” he said. Still, the police had to increase security at mosques in Liverpool in the wake of the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. And a mosque in Birkenhead, on the opposite bank of the Mersey River from Liverpool, was vandalized after the July 7 attack in London in 2005. The Merseyside police force recorded a 75 percent increase in hate crimes from 2012 to 2016. Mr. Salah, though, has helped “turn that pressure off,” Mr. Atthababi said. Songs in his honor boom out at Anfield, Liverpool’s storied home stadium, and fans carry flags bearing his image, complete with Pharaonic headdress. Mr. Salah is mobbed wherever he goes, asked for selfies at filling stations and at fish-and-chip shops. That is natural in a city defined as much by its two soccer teams as it is by its musical heritage, the hometown of the Beatles. “He is the quiet, unassuming kid who puts on his Liverpool shirt and becomes a superhero, the embodiment of every fan’s dream,” said James McKenna of Spirit of Shankly, a Liverpool fans’ group. But the fact that it is a Muslim being feted is significant, too. “Every Muslim is proud of him,” said Ali Aden, selling groceries and a surprisingly large range of perfumes from his stall outside Al Rahma Mosque in Liverpool. “Sometimes, we are made to feel like second-class citizens. For someone to come from the Middle East to our city is a great source of pride.” One song in his honor has the lyrics, “If he scores another few, then I’ll be Muslim, too,” and it has not gone unnoticed. Though the chant has attracted some criticism, Anwar Uddin, a former player who now works for the Football Supporters’ Federation on its diversity programming, says he thinks it is well intentioned. “Things like that can break down barriers,” he said, pointing out that the simple sight of seeing Mr. Salah bow and reflect after scoring a goal can help to “remove the stigma” that some may attach to the sight of a Muslim praying. “He can help to bridge the Muslim community and the rest of the city,” Mr. Atthababi said. “He can show people that we are closer to Salah than we are to extremists.” To others, though, the message that Mr. Salah’s success sends to Muslims is just as important, because he made his triumphant return to England four years after being buried on the bench for a season at Chelsea. “He gives more confidence to the younger generation especially,” Dr. Albarbandi said. “You can see and feel the impact. They are more active, more outgoing, their morale is higher. He has shown that if you engage, if you work hard and prove yourself, nobody is going to stop you praying, nobody is going to stop you wearing a beard. People will respect you, whoever you are.” Outside Al Rahma mosque, Abdul Aziz and Mohamed Yaffe were hurrying to Friday prayers. Mr. Yaffe was happy to talk about Mr. Salah; Mr. Yaffe is a Liverpool fan, enamored as anyone with the team’s star. Mr. Aziz, though, demurred a little. “These are difficult questions to answer,” he said. Mr. Yaffe looked at him sympathetically. “He’s an Everton fan,” he said, by way of explanation, referring to Liverpool’s city rivals. Mr. Aziz smiled. As long as Mr. Salah does not score against Everton, he said, he is happy for him, happy for what he is doing for the community. That is one gap Mr. Salah has already bridged. “Faith comes first,” Mr. Aziz said."

84,2018-05-02,Report Indicates Greitens' Campaign Lied About Donor List,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/us/ap-us-missouri-governor.html,1205," By The Associated Press JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — A former campaign aide to Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens testified that he was duped into taking the fall when the governor's campaign was trying to explain how it had gotten a list of top donors to a veterans' charity that Greitens had founded, according to a legislative report released Wednesday. The report from a special House investigatory committee indicates that Greitens himself received the donor list of The Mission Continues so he could call key supporters and explain that he was stepping down as CEO in 2014. It says Greitens later directed political aides to work off the charity's list to raise money for his gubernatorial campaign — even though he had signed an agreement never to disclose the charity's confidential donor information. ""The report shows the governor took advantage of a charity that works hard to take care of our veterans,"" said Republican Rep. Jay Barnes, chairman of the bipartisan committee charged with investigating whether to try to impeach and remove the first-term Republican governor from office. The charity donor list ""was taken without permission and used inappropriately for political gain.""  Transcripts of an aide's testimony indicate that Greitens' campaign lied when it settled a Missouri Ethics Commission complaint last year by categorizing the charity list as an in-kind donation valued at $600 provided on March 1, 2015, by Daniel Laub, who had functioned as Greitens' campaign manager. ""The whole document made me sick,"" Laub said in an April 18 deposition. ""One, because it was misrepresented; and two, because now I was in a round of news stories falsely portraying what happened."" The House report also indicates that Greitens began consulting with and paying political advisers before he officially created a campaign committee in February 2015, raising more questions about whether he skirted state campaign finance laws. Catherine Hanaway, an attorney who lost to Greitens in the 2016 Republican primary, issued a statement on behalf of Greitens' campaign committee saying that Barnes never asked or allowed it to provide testimony. Former Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice Edward ""Chip"" Robertson Jr., who is counsel to the House committee, in response said the House will issue subpoenas to campaign personnel. In a statement, he said the committee report had its desired effect: causing those affiliated with Greitens' team ""to offer to do what they have so far refused to do when asked — to provide information to the committee."" Hanaway also defended the decision to report Laub as the source of the charity list by noting that the list already was in his possession when Greitens officially created his political committee. ""This is, at its core, a minor campaign finance issue,"" Hanaway said. Greitens already faces a felony charge of tampering with computer data for allegedly disclosing the charity donor list to his political fundraiser in 2015 without the St. Louis-based charity's permission. Greitens has not been charged with filing a false campaign report, which is misdemeanor crime, but authorities are reviewing the matter. Greitens also faces a May 14 trial in St. Louis on a felony invasion-of-privacy indictment for allegedly taking and transmitting a nonconsensual photo of an at least partially nude woman in March 2015. Greitens has acknowledged having a consensual affair with his former hairdresser but has denied criminal wrongdoing. The House investigatory committee released an initial report April 11 with the woman's testimony that Greitens restrained, slapped and threatened her during sexual encounters that at times left her crying and afraid. The latest report, like the first one, simply lays forth facts without drawing conclusions about impeachment.  The Associated Press first reported in October 2016 that Greitens' campaign had obtained a list of individuals, corporations and other nonprofits that had given at least $1,000 to The Mission Continues. The AP reported that Greitens raised about $2 million from those who had previously given significant amounts to the charity. At the time Greitens told the AP: ""No, we were not working off of a Mission Continues donor list."" But he acknowledged soliciting campaign money from some people he had gotten to know while working at the charity. The House report indicates Greitens actually was working off a Mission Continues list of top donors. Email records show the donor list was emailed May 8, 2014, to Greitens and other Mission Continues employees, including Krystal Taylor, who simultaneously worked for Greitens' personal promotional company, The Greitens Group. Taylor is now Krystal Proctor. Although federal law bars 501(c)(3) charities such as The Mission Continues from intervening in political campaigns on behalf of candidates, a Greitens attorney has suggested Greitens was entitled to the list because he built it ""donor by donor, friend by friend."" The Mission Continues president, Spencer Kympton, testified that the list was covered by a nondisclosure agreement signed by Greitens in November 2012 and included donors cultivated through a variety of means, not just by Greitens. The report details multiple instances in which Greitens allegedly directed the charity list to be shared for political purposes, including during meetings in 2014 to discuss his upcoming gubernatorial campaign. Proctor said she also provided it at Greitens' direction to Laub and political consultant Michael Hafner in January 2015. When Meredith Gibbons was hired as Greitens' campaign finance director, documents show that Proctor sent her an April 22, 2015, email with The Mission Continues donor list attached — a transmission that was the basis for the charge filed last month. After the AP's story in October 2016, former Democratic Party Chairman Roy Temple filed an ethics complaint asserting that the charity list should have been reported by Greitens' campaign. In an April 2017 settlement with the Missouri Ethics Commission, Greitens' campaign agreed to pay a small fine and amended its finance reports to show the list as a donation from Laub. But Laub testified that he wasn't the source of the list and didn't realize he was agreeing to say he was when Greitens' campaign aide Austin Chambers called him in April 2017. Laub said Chambers had explained that ""we need to put someone's name down who was on the campaign at the time"" to settle an ethics complaint. Laub said he assumed he was agreeing to being listed as the campaign manager — not as the source of the list. Chambers, who took over for Laub as campaign manager in fall 2015, on Wednesday called Laub ""a disgruntled former employee."" ""To say that I provided false information, or misled Laub to go along with false information, is absolutely untrue,"" Chambers said. The report also notes that Greitens was making political moves long before he officially formed a campaign committee in February 2015. A political consultant sent him a donor list of a potential gubernatorial rival, then-Auditor Tom Schweich, in October 2013, and Laub and Hafner began informally advising Greitens in early 2014. Laub testified that he was hired in December 2014 by Greitens' limited-liability corporation ""to prepare his political plans"" and help with a book tour. Hafner said he began officially working for Greitens as a political adviser in January 2015, paid either directly by Greitens or The Greitens Group. State law says candidates must form a campaign committee with the Missouri Ethics Commission whenever they raise or spend more than $500.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
85,2018-05-02,"Iran Detains British-Iranian, Iranian With British Council",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/middleeast/ap-ml-iran-dual-nationals.html,789," By The Associated Press DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Iranian-British national and an Iranian working for the British Council who traveled to Iran on a private trip to visit family have been detained in Iran, becoming the latest individuals with Western ties held in the Islamic Republic. The British Foreign Office told The Associated Press on Wednesday that it was ""urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities"" after being asked about the detention of Iranian-British national Mahan Abdein. Separately, the British Council said in a statement it was aware of the detention of a staffer following the arrest of Iranian national Aras Amiri. Iranian officials and state media have not reported the arrests. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The news website IranWire, created by Iranian-Canadian journalist and one-time Iran detainee Maziar Bahari, first reported the two new detentions. Abdein, an Iran analyst and director of a company called Dysart Consulting, previously had appeared on Iranian state television, typically a sign of being at least sympathetic to Iran's government. He also wrote occasional columns for the website Middle East Monitor. Circumstances of his arrest remained unclear Wednesday night. Amiri, identified by IranWire as being a 23-year-old student at Kingston University, was arrested while visiting family on a private trip, the British Council said. Though the British Embassy in Tehran has reopened, the British Council has been closed since 2009. The council is a non-political organization that works in education, arts and culture. ""Despite an assertion that this individual has travelled to Iran for work this is not the case,"" the council said. Their arrests come after the hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard's arrest of Abbas Edalat, a British-Iranian professor at Imperial College London who actively campaigns against military action targeting his homeland, became public last week. The semi-official Fars news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, cited an unnamed source accusing Edalat and others from a British group of leading the 2009 unrest in Iran surrounding the disputed re-election of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Fars offered no evidence supporting the allegation and named no one other than Edalat at the time. Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, so detainees like Edalat and Abdein cannot receive consular assistance. A U.N. panel in September described ""an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals"" in Iran, which Tehran denied. Analysts and family members of dual nationals and others detained in Iran say hard-liners in the Islamic Republic's security agencies use the prisoners as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West. Iran and Britain have been discussing the possible release of some 400 million pounds held by London since the 1979 Islamic Revolution for a tank purchase that never happened. A prisoner exchange in January 2016 that freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans also saw the U.S. make a $400 million cash delivery to Iran the same day. That money too involved undelivered military equipment from the shah's era, though some U.S. politicians have criticized the delivery as a ransom payment. Others with ties to the West detained in Iran include Chinese-American graduate student Xiyue Wang, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for allegedly ""infiltrating"" the country while doing doctoral research on Iran's Qajar dynasty. Iranian-Canadian national Abdolrasoul Dorri Esfahani, a member of Iran's 2015 nuclear negotiating team, is believed to be serving a five-year sentence on espionage charges. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman, also is serving a five-year prison sentence for allegedly planning the ""soft toppling"" of Iran's government while traveling with her young daughter. Iranian businessman Siamak Namazi and his 81-year-old father Baquer, a former UNICEF representative who served as governor of Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province under the U.S.-backed shah, are both serving 10-year sentences on espionage charges. Iranian-American art dealer Karan Vafadari and his Iranian wife, Afarin Neyssari, recently received 27-year and 16-year prison sentences respectively. Iranian-American Robin Shahini was released on bail last year after staging a hunger strike while serving an 18-year prison sentence for ""collaboration with a hostile government."" Shahini is believed to still be in Iran. Also in an Iranian prison is Nizar Zakka, a U.S. permanent resident from Lebanon who advocated for internet freedom and has done work for the U.S. government. He was sentenced to 10 years last year on espionage-related charges. Former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran in 2007 while on an unauthorized CIA mission, remains missing as well. Iran says that Levinson is not in the country and that it has no further information about him, though his family holds Tehran responsible for his disappearance. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap .

86,2018-05-02,Germany Confident Eurofighter Supplier Issue Can Be Resolved Soon,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-eurofighter-germany.html,460," By Reuters BERLIN — Germany said on Wednesday it hoped to resolve the restricted supply of certain components for its fleet of 129 Eurofighter jets in coming weeks, and the issue should not derail its plans to resume air policing in the Baltic region from September. Defence Ministry spokesman Colonel Holger Neumann told reporters the German air force was able to meet its military requirements despite the issue with components needed for the warplane's self-protection system. The component issue, first reported by Spiegel Online on Tuesday, centers on a so-called ""grease nipple"" that is part of the system that cools the wingtip pods that house elements of the self-protection system, which was designed by BAE Systems. Supplies of the component have been restricted while the primary supplier, a U.S.-based company, is recertified after a change in its ownership, industry sources said. ""We hope to get this problem under control in several weeks or months,"" Neumann told a regular German government news conference. He declined to give any details about how many of Germany's Eurofighters were affected by the spare parts logjam. The ministry acknowledged that the component supply issue could exacerbate existing problems with the readiness of the Eurofighter warplanes, but declined to give any details. It was not immediately clear if the issue also affected the five other countries that have received Eurofighter jets under a joint project of Britain's BAE Systems, European airplane maker Airbus and Italy's Leonardo. More than 500 of the jets have been delivered to Germany, Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria and Saudi Arabia. One industry source said the consortium was not aware of other countries affected by the component issue. Sources familiar with the issue denied a report by Spiegel Online that only 10 German Eurofighter jets were ready for use as a result of the issue, noting that at least 14 jets were in use around the world at the moment. Airbus said the restricted supply of the components was ""being urgently addressed by the Eurofighter industrial community"" and it would work closely with the German air force to minimize the impact of the situation. It said it had provided the German Air Force with ""a package of best practices, training and workarounds to mitigate the shortage of components and has put in place measures to increase the output of repairs to the existing inventory."" Sources familiar with the issue said the German government was notified about the issue at the end of March, and faulted BAE for failing to provide further advance notice of the issue, which would have allowed preemptive orders of needed parts. A spokeswoman for BAE said the company was supporting the Airbus-led efforts to address the issue as part of the Eurofighter consortium.

87,2018-05-02,Texas Teen Charged With Plotting IS-Inspired Shooting at Mall,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/us/02reuters-usa-shooting-arrest.html,630," By Reuters WASHINGTON — A 17-year-old boy in Plano, Texas, has been arrested and charged with plotting a mass shooting inspired by the Islamic State at a shopping mall, law enforcement agencies said on Wednesday. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and police said high-school student Matin Azizi-Yarand had planned the attack for mid-May and had sought to recruit others for the shooting. Authorities also said he had drafted a ""Message to America"" justifying his planned attack.  The FBI and local authorities in Collin County, Texas, said that at the time of his arrest, Azizi-Yarand had sent ""more than $1,400 to others"" to buy weapons and tactical gear. In an affidavit, investigators said Azizi-Yarand began communicating online with an FBI ""confidential human source"" last December about his desire to travel abroad or to conduct an attack in the United States. He compared himself to other recent ""lone wolf"" attackers, investigators said. ""Look at all the other lone wolves// What training did they have yet they simply killed the kuffar?"" Azizi-Yarand told the FBI source, using the Arabic word for ""disbelievers,"" according to the affidavit. Prosecutors say Azizi-Yarand told the FBI source: ""The brothers in Europe the brother in Spain the brother in New York? Had no military training//it's not about numbers it's about getting a message across to these taghut countries,"" using an Islamic term denoting a focus of worship other than Allah. Later in the discussion, investigators say, Azizi-Yarand told the FBI source he wanted ""to put America in the state that Europe is in which is having to have soldiers deployed in streets.""  In other conversations, investigators say, Azizi-Yarand talked about his interest in traveling to Pakistan and then crossing into Afghanistan where he could join the Islamic State. At another point, he told the FBI source he knew a person in India who had information on jihadi activity in Libya, and who invited Azizi-Yarand to travel there with him. In one conversation, Azizi-Yarand said that he had converted to Islam, in part because of ""fighting."" ""When I first became Muslim fighting was a big part of why I came to this religion,"" he said. ""I saw men facing so many tribulations but remained steadfast and believed in Allah. That's one of the Core things that led me to convert seeing the strength the Muslims had."" In numerous online conversations, investigators said, Azizi-Yarand shared multiple forms of Islamic State propaganda. At another point, he sent the FBI source a document authored by one of the 1999 shooters at Columbine High School in Colorado containing detailed instructions for building pipe bombs. The suspect also discussed various possible targets for a domestic U.S. attack, including a school. Later still, Azizi-Yarand discussed with an undercover FBI employee the possibility of attacking a shopping mall during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and at one point sent the FBI employee three pictures of a mall near Plano called the Stonebriar Centre. While the FBI and a Joint Terrorism Task force conducted the investigation leading to Azizi-Yarand's arrest, so far he has only being charged under Texas state law.  Under federal law, the 17-year-old is considered a juvenile, U.S. prosecutors in Texas said. ""Federal law limits our ability to certify a juvenile as an adult for prosecution, and in light of that, we determined that state prosecution of the subject will best address the case,"" U.S. Attorney Joseph Brown said in a statement. Authorities said if that if Azizi-Yarand is convicted, he would face up to life in prison for soliciting others to participate in his planned attack, and up to 10 years in prison for making a terroristic threat. Azizi-Yarand is in custody and bond has been set at $3 million.  (Reporting by Lisa Lambert and Mark Hosenball; editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
88,2018-05-02,Key Dates in the Chilean Sex Abuse Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/europe/ap-eu-vatican-chile-timeline.html,1034," By The Associated Press VATICAN CITY — The three main whistleblowers in Chile's long-running sex abuse scandal have wrapped up their meetings with Pope Francis, after the pope discredited them and staunchly defended a bishop they had accused of witnessing and ignoring their abuse. Their visit to the Vatican marked the culmination of an extraordinary papal about-face, after Francis ordered a thorough investigation into their claims and then, after receiving the report, admitted to ""serious errors in judgment."" Some key dates in the Barros affair: ___ Jan. 10, 2015 Pope names Bishop Juan Barros, then Chile's military chaplain, as bishop of Osorno, over the objections of some members of the Chilean bishops' conference. They were concerned about the fallout from the scandal over the Rev. Fernando Karadima, Chile's most notorious predator priest. ___ Jan. 31, 2015 Francis acknowledged the bishops' concerns in a letter, obtained by The Associated Press, which revealed a plan to have Barros and two other Karadima-trained bishops resign and take yearlong sabbaticals. In the letter, Francis said the plan fell apart because the nuncio revealed it. The pope subsequently told reporters that he himself had blocked the plan because there was no ""evidence"" Barros was guilty of any cover-up. ___ February 2015 Fifty Chilean lawmakers and priests, deacons and more than 1,000 laity in the Osorno diocese sign petitions protesting Barros' appointment and urging Francis revoke it. ___ Feb. 3, 2015 Juan Carlos Cruz writes a letter to the Vatican's ambassador in Santiago, Monsignor Ivo Scapolo, accusing Barros of watching the sex abuse he experienced and doing nothing to stop it. The letter would form the basis of a subsequent letter to the pope. It is unknown what Scapolo did with his letter. ___ March 21, 2015 The Mass installing Barros as bishop of Osorno is marred by violent protests. Ten days later, the Vatican publicly defends Barros, saying it ""carefully examined the prelate's candidature and did not find objective reasons to preclude the appointment."" ___ March 26, 2015 Five members of the pope's Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors tell AP of their concern about the Barros appointment given allegations by victims he covered up for Karadima. ___ April 12, 2015 Four commission members fly to Rome to meet with Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Francis' top abuse adviser, to raise concerns about Barros. Member Marie Collins hands over Cruz's letter outlining his complaints about Barros, to O'Malley for the pope. O'Malley would later tell Collins and Cruz he delivered it to the pope and relayed their concerns. ___ May 15, 2015 Pope is filmed in St. Peter's Square telling the spokesman for the Chilean bishops' conference that the opposition to Barros was coming from ""leftists."" Francis says: ""Osorno suffers, yes, from foolishness, because they don't open their heart to what God says and they let themselves guided by the nonsense all those people say."" ___ Sept. 9, 2015 Chile's El Mostrador publishes emails between the current and former archbishops of Santiago in which they maneuver to try to prevent Cruz from appearing at a conference on abuse or participating in Francis' abuse commission. At the time, the three victims were in civil litigation against the archdiocese for alleged cover-up; the lawsuit was thrown out but is being appealed. ___ Jan. 15, 2018 Francis arrives in Chile to protests that are unprecedented for a papal visit. During his first public remarks, he apologizes for the ""irreparable damage"" suffered by all victims of sexual abuse. He meets with two survivors and weeps with them. Neither are Karadima victims. ___ Jan. 18, 2018 While visiting the northern city of Iquique, Francis is asked by a Chilean journalist about Barros and says: ""The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I'll speak. There is not one shred of proof against him. It's all calumny. Is that clear?"" ___ Jan. 20, 2018 Cardinal O'Malley publicly rebukes the pope, saying his words in Iquique ""were a source of great pain"" for abuse survivors. ___ Jan. 21, 2018 Francis partially apologizes, saying he shouldn't have used the word ""proof"" but rather ""evidence."" During an in-flight news conference returning home from South America, Francis repeats that accusations against Barros were ""calumny"" and denies any victims had come forward accusing Barros of covering up for Karadima. ""I'm convinced he's innocent,"" he said. ___ Jan. 30, 2018 The Vatican announces its most experienced sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, would travel to Chile ""to listen to those who have expressed the desire to provide elements"" about the Barros case. Scicluna subsequently changes plans so he can meet in person with Cruz in New York. ___ Feb. 5, 2018 The AP reports the contents of Cruz's 2015 letter to the pope, which contradicted Francis' claim that no victims had ever come forward. Cruz wrote: ""Holy Father, it's bad enough that we suffered such tremendous pain and anguish from the sexual and psychological abuse, but the terrible mistreatment we received from our pastors is almost worse."" ___ Feb. 17, 2018 Archbishop Scicluna and his colleague, the Rev. Jordi Bertomeu, meet for more than three hours with Cruz at a Manhattan church. ""For the first time I felt that someone is listening,"" Cruz said afterward. Scicluna and Bertomeu then travel to Chile where they take testimony from more than 60 witnesses. ___ April 11, 2018 Pope releases letter to Chilean bishops admitting he made ""serious errors in judgment"" about the Barros case, apologizes to victims and invites them to Rome to beg their forgiveness in person. He also warns the Chilean church is in for reform and summons all Chile's bishops to an extraordinary meeting in Rome in late May. ___ April 27, 2018 Pope begins days of meetings with Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo in what the Vatican says is a climate of ""reparation for suffering."" ___ May 2, 2018 At the end of the meetings, the three men urge pope to transform his apology into concrete action to end ""epidemic"" of abuse and cover-up. Cruz says pope told him: ""I was part of the problem. I caused this, and I apologize to you."" ___ This version corrects the date that the pope's letter was released to April 11, not April 12.

89,2018-05-02,Deutsche Boerse to Cut 300 Jobs in Cost-Cutting Drive-Handelsblatt,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/business/02reuters-deutsche-boerse-jobs.html,184," By Reuters FRANKFURT — Deutsche Boerse AG plans to cut around 300 jobs as new CEO Theodor Weimer seeks to lower operating costs by 100 million euros (88 million pounds) through to 2020, Handelsblatt reported on Wednesday. The business daily, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said Weimer hoped to achieve the headcount reductions by offering older staff buyouts or early retirement. ""This will all be cushioned in a socially sensible way,"" the newspaper quoted one source familiar with the matter as saying. Deutsche Boerse named Wiemer, a former UniCredit banker, as CEO last November after Carsten Kengeter resigned amid an insider trading investigation. Kengeter, who denied wrongdoing, had led talks on merging Deutsche Boerse with the London Stock Exchange that unravelled after Britain's referendum vote to leave the European Union. Handelsblatt, citing company insiders, said few staff had been offered buyouts while Kengeter was at the helm and there would be willing takers if offers were made now. Deutsche Boerse employs more than 5,640 people. Deutsche Boerse declined to comment on the report.

Iran Wire said it had received word of the arrest of Mahan Abedin in the past week, quoting an unidentified source in the capital Tehran. It did not spell out when or where Abedin was arrested or where he lived, but its report indicated that he was visiting Iran when taken into custody. Asked about Abedin's arrest, Britain’s Foreign Office said: “We are urgently seeking information from the Iranian authorities following reports of the arrest of a British-Iranian dual national.” Last Wednesday, the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained Abbas Edalat, a British-Iranian national who is a professor of computer science at Imperial College in London, in mid-April. Asked about reports of Edalat's detention, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi told reporters in Tehran on Sunday: ""I confirm his arrest on security charges, but I am unable to give details,"" according to state broadcaster IRIB. At least three other British-Iranian dual citizens are known to be held in the Islamic Republic, whose relations with Britain have been strained for many years. Separately, Aras Amiri, who works for the British Council in Britain, was arrested in Tehran in mid-March, her cousin, Mohsen Omrani, announced in a series of tweets on Wednesday. The British Foreign Office said she was not a British citizen.  The Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals since 2015, most for alleged espionage, Reuters reported in November.

91,2018-05-02,Washington Redskins Cheerleaders Describe Topless Photo Shoot and Uneasy Night Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/sports/redskins-cheerleaders-nfl.html,2559," By Juliet Macur When the Washington Redskins took their cheerleading squad to Costa Rica in 2013 for a calendar photo shoot, the first cause for concern among the cheerleaders came when Redskins officials collected their passports upon arrival at the resort, depriving them of their official identification. For the photo shoot, at the adults-only Occidental Grand Papagayo resort on Culebra Bay, some of the cheerleaders said they were required to be topless, though the photographs used for the calendar would not show nudity. Others wore nothing but body paint. Given the resort’s secluded setting, such revealing poses would not have been a concern for the women — except that the Redskins had invited spectators. A contingent of sponsors and FedExField suite holders — all men — were granted up-close access to the photo shoots. One evening, at the end of a 14-hour day that included posing and dance practices, the squad’s director told nine of the 36 cheerleaders that their work was not done. They had a special assignment for the night. Some of the male sponsors had picked them to be personal escorts at a nightclub. “So get back to your room and get ready,” the director told them. Several of them began to cry. “They weren’t putting a gun to our heads, but it was mandatory for us to go,” one of the cheerleaders said. “We weren’t asked, we were told. Other girls were devastated because we knew exactly what she was doing.” [No Sweatpants in Public: Inside the Rule Books for N.F.L. Cheerleaders] Their participation did not involve sex, the cheerleaders said, but they felt as if the arrangement amounted to “pimping us out.” What bothered them was their team director’s demand that they go as sex symbols to please male sponsors, which they did not believe should be a part of their job. The Redskins’ weeklong trip to Costa Rica in 2013 — for which the cheerleaders were paid nothing beyond transportation costs, meals and lodging, the team said — provides a vivid illustration of how N.F.L. teams have used cheerleaders for far more than sideline dancers during games. Their treatment has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks since two former N.F.L. cheerleaders filed discrimination complaints and described a hostile work environment in which they were often dangled as sex objects for the titillation of male fans away from the games. Interviews with dozens of current and former N.F.L. cheerleaders revealed a common perspective: They enjoyed performing at games, developing friendships with other cheerleaders and participating in charity work, which included visiting hospitals and going overseas to entertain military troops. But they were disturbed by some of the extracurricular requirements that put them in what they considered unsafe situations. This account of the Redskins’ calendar shoot at the Occidental Grand Papagayo is based on interviews with five cheerleaders who were involved, and many details were corroborated with others who heard descriptions of the trip at the time. The cheerleaders spoke on condition of anonymity because they were required to sign confidentiality agreements when they joined the team. “It’s just not right to send cheerleaders out with strange men when some of the girls clearly don’t want to go,” one cheerleader who was there said. “But unfortunately, I feel like it won’t change until something terrible happens, like a girl is assaulted in some way, or raped. I think teams will start paying attention to this only when it’s too late.” Stephanie Jojokian, the longtime director and choreographer for the Redskins’ cheerleaders, disputed much of the women’s description of the Costa Rica trip. She vehemently denied that the night at the club was mandatory and said that the cheerleaders who went were not chosen by sponsors. “I was not forcing anyone to go at all,” Ms. Jojokian said. “I’m the mama bear, and I really look out for everybody, not just the cheerleaders. It’s a big family. We respect each other and our craft. It’s such a supportive environment for these ladies.” In a statement, the Redskins said: “The Redskins’ cheerleader program is one of the NFL’s premier teams in participation, professionalism, and community service. Each Redskin cheerleader is contractually protected to ensure a safe and constructive environment. The work our cheerleaders do in our community, visiting our troops abroad, and supporting our team on the field is something the Redskins organization and our fans take great pride in.” A spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league office “has no role in how the clubs which have cheerleaders utilize them.” He reiterated a statement the league has issued in response to previous news reports regarding the treatment of cheerleaders: “Our office will work with our clubs in sharing best practices and employment-related processes that will support club cheerleading squads within an appropriate and supportive workplace.” After Daniel Snyder bought the Redskins in 1999, the cheerleading program was given a makeover. He brought it in-house — it had operated independently — and its style became increasingly risqué. Mr. Snyder was “bringing the craft closer to pole dancing with every season,” said a 2009 column in The Washington City Paper, which referred to an advertisement on Mr. Snyder’s WTEM-AM sports talk radio station that year. In the ad, breathy male voices discussed a listener contest in which “five lucky winners” would have Redskins cheerleaders wash their cars. One man asked the other if he would like the cheerleaders “soaping up and scrubbing you.” In an interactive feature on the Redskins’ website, fans were able to play a version of the “hot or not” game, clicking on a flame to pick between images of two cheerleaders. In online video interviews in the past, the cheerleaders were asked, “Describe your perfect date” and “What’s the first thing you notice about a man?” (Since publication of this article, the “hot or not” interactive has been removed). Many Redskins cheerleaders understand the team’s approach — sex sells — and remain enthusiastic supporters of the team. They said they were troubled, however, when their safety was not taken seriously. There is no leaguewide policy for security, or a union to protect them. A half-dozen Redskins cheerleaders said Ms. Jojokian seemed especially focused on preserving relationships with businessmen who supported the team and her nonprofit dance company, Capitol Movement. “There was a lot of pressure by the director for us to be a part of that party atmosphere with sponsors because we knew she picked favorites that way,” one cheerleader said of Ms. Jojokian, who in 2011 told women auditioning for the squad, according to WJLA-TV in Washington: “Don’t cover your chest area too much. We’ll assume you are trying to hide something.” In an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Jojokian choked up when she considered that some cheerleaders felt she did not fully support them. “It breaks my heart because I’m a mom and I’ve done this for a long time,” she said. “Where is this coming from? I would never put a woman in a situation like that. I actually mentor these women to be strong and to speak up, and it kills me to hear that.” The Redskins, who said that only six sponsors, including two couples, attended the calendar shoot trip, made available for interviews two cheerleaders who were captains of the squad in 2013. Both women, who spoke on condition of anonymity, praised Ms. Jojokian and said she never forced the cheerleaders to do anything they didn’t want to do. They said they thoroughly enjoyed their experiences as Redskins cheerleaders. Regarding the evening out with sponsors in Costa Rica, one of them said, “It was actually just a night of relaxation and to be away from it all.” A recent contract for Redskins cheerleaders said off-the-field work would include “community and charitable events, youth camps, etc.” There was no mention of having to entertain men who financially support the team, and these appearances raised flags for some cheerleaders. [Related: How N.F.L. Teams Use Social Media to Promote, and Control, Cheerleaders] In 2012, Ms. Jojokian, a former squad director and choreographer for the N.B.A.’s Washington Wizards, announced a mandatory team-bonding boat trip. At a pier in Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood where the cheerleaders were to board, they discovered that it wasn’t the commercial party boat they had expected. It was a yacht with several men aboard — including a familiar face, William R. Teel Jr. Mr. Teel, 52, was a longtime Redskins suite holder and a local businessman with close ties to the team. He lent cornerback Carlos Rogers $125,000 in 2009, and later sued Mr. Rogers to get the money back. He also maintained a close relationship with the cheerleading program. For about a decade, one or both of Mr. Teel’s companies, Energy Enterprise Solutions and 1 Source Consulting, sponsored the cheerleading program and, for a few years, Capitol Movement, Ms. Jojokian’s dance company. As an Army veteran, he said he was drawn to sponsor the cheerleading team because of the many trips it took to entertain United States military troops overseas. As a sponsor, he helped judge cheerleader tryouts and occasionally was invited to buy package deals to attend calendar shoots. Mr. Teel also paid for Redskins cheerleaders to go to Super Bowls. Ms. Jojokian said that Mr. Teel always made deals with the cheerleaders “on his own” for those Super Bowl trips and that those trips were not sanctioned by the Redskins. Mr. Teel said, however, that he always worked through Ms. Jojokian to determine which cheerleaders would participate on his trips and that he always provided security. Ms. Jojokian said that she, too, was not expecting to see strangers on Mr. Teel’s boat that day. “I didn’t necessarily feel that we were bonding in a way that was helpful for the whole season,” she said. Five cheerleaders characterized that 2012 team-bonding party as a wild gathering, where men shot liquor into the cheerleaders’ mouths with turkey basters. Below the deck, men handed out cash prizes in twerking contests. No cheerleaders claimed that they were touched inappropriately, and the two team captains said the trip was pleasant. One added, “They were all adults and got out of the experience what they wanted to get out of it.” One cheerleader a few years later was told what to expect at the annual affair. “I’d been given a heads-up that we were going on this particular man’s yacht and that he had a lot of money — and that you could make a lot of money there if you wanted,” one cheerleader said, referring to the prize money in the dance contests. “But that was not for me, and lots of us felt the same way. But we were too scared to complain. We felt that our place on the team would be compromised if we did.” Mr. Teel, whose name is still painted on two prime parking spots at FedExField though he no longer owns a suite at the stadium, was adamant in saying that nothing inappropriate happened on his boat and that he always treated the cheerleaders with respect. “I have five sisters,” he said, adding that at his boat parties “no one was allowed to be disrespected.” He added that the Redskins had asked him if they could use his yacht for the 2012 cheerleading team’s event. “It wasn’t just alcohol, it was a fully catered event at my cost, by the way, in appreciation for the work they do,” he said. “The people who wanted to get off, got off. The people that wanted to stay, stayed. I don’t believe that anyone was pressured by their management to attend events or to be nice to sponsors. The team bonding was just team bonding. Were people dancing? Yeah, but I don’t know about money for a contest.” For the Costa Rica trip, the cheerleaders had a dress code: white tops, khaki bottoms and heels. Straw hats were permitted, while flats were definitely not. Their suitcases were packed with bathing suits, which they had to purchase for the photo shoots, and food. Disordered eating was common on the team, several of the cheerleaders said. Laxative abuse was prevalent. Many N.F.L. teams, if not all of them, have weight restrictions in cheerleaders’ contracts, forbidding them to gain more than a few pounds. The Occidental Grand Papagayo is an all-inclusive resort, but the women did not feel they could indulge in the buffets. Besides, they said, they often were too busy to eat proper meals. They said their hotel rooms turned into markets, with stacks of fiber and protein bars, rice cakes, peanut butter and cans of tuna. During the photo shoots, they were anxiously aware when the sponsors and other guests were watching. “At one of my friend’s shoots, we were basically standing around her like a human barricade because she was basically naked, so we could keep the guys from seeing her,” one of the cheerleaders said. “I was getting so angry that the guys on the trip were skeezing around in the background.” The nine cheerleaders picked to escort the sponsors to a nightclub boarded a hotel van without any Redskins management. When they showed up at the club, it was dark and nearly empty, several of them said. But the men who had requested them were there. The cheerleaders said they were further bothered by the fact that Redskins officials were there, too. Ms. Jojokian was not, but Lon Rosenberg, the senior vice president for operations, and Dennis Greene, the president for business operations, were. A former Redskins cheerleader who volunteered as a sideline assistant during games was encouraging the women to drink and flirt, the cheerleaders said. “The issue was that management seemed to condone all of this,” one cheerleader who was there said. At the end of the night, at about 2 or 3 a.m., the women returned to the waiting van, only to be stopped by several police officers who asked for their passports. They did not have them because the team had taken possession of them upon arrival. (The Redskins said it was team policy to collect passports for all international travel as a security precaution.) “I guess they thought you were prostitutes,” a man affiliated with the cheerleading squad told them after they were allowed to leave. They returned to the resort, but several women on the team decided not to return to the squad the next season. What happened in Costa Rica, they said, made them feel worthless and unprotected. “You kept telling yourself that it was going to get better,” one of those women said. “But it never got better. Finally, I had to admit to myself, this is not what I thought it would be.” Ms. Jojokian said she recalled the cheerleaders saying they enjoyed the night at the club in Costa Rica. When she asked the women how the party was the next morning, “They were like, that was fun,” she said. “I’m like, glad you had a good time — don’t get the other girls jealous that they couldn’t get to go.” She added: “No sponsor is worth these children’s safety and well-being at all. “I have to really reflect and think because I try to teach these women, these cheerleaders, to speak up, not just to me but to anybody. They shouldn’t deal with anyone who is hurtful or harmful.” video       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
92,2018-05-02,Guinea Opposition Calls for Parliamentary Inquiry Into Bollore,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/world/africa/02reuters-france-bollore-guinea.html,456," By Reuters CONAKRY — Opposition lawmakers in Guinea on Wednesday called for a parliamentary inquiry into billionaire tycoon Vincent Bollore's dealings in the West African nation, which are under investigation in France. French authorities are looking into allegations that a unit of his company Groupe Bollore undercharged for work on behalf of presidential candidates in Guinea and Togo in return for port contracts. Guinea's Justice Minister Cheick Sako told Reuters last week that it would cooperate with the French investigation. Guinea's opposition holds just 37 of a total of 114 seats in parliament so will require support from at least some of Conde's allies in order to move forward with an inquiry, but the call shows the risk of a public backlash in West Africa to the news. ""We demand the creation of a parliamentary commission of inquiry to shine light on the Bollore affair,"" Ousmane Gaoual Diallo, an MP from opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo's Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), told Reuters. ""We made a proposal for this and it will be before the office of the speaker of the National Assembly tomorrow morning,"" he said. Bollore's lawyer, Olivier Baratelli, has denied any wrongdoing by his client, who is under formal investigation for allegations including corrupting foreign public officials and complicity in breach of trust, forgery and use of forgery, according to a French judicial source.  Groupe Bollore, whose Chief Executive Gilles Alix, is also a target of the investigation, has denied the allegations as well.  The sprawling company has confirmed that its African business interests were being investigated over the billing of work by its communications business Havas Worldwide in Guinea and Togo between 2009 and 2010.  Allegations in Guinea center on a concession to manage and expand the container terminal in the capital Conakry. France's Getma International won the contract in a 2008 tender, beating rivals including Bollore - the dominant port and rail operator across French-speaking West and Central Africa.  Guinea's current President Alpha Conde came to power after narrowly defeating Diallo in a 2010 election and canceled the agreement with Getma in March of the following year. Bollore took over the concession the same month.  Former transport minister Alpha Ibrahima Keira said last week that Havas' work during the election had nothing to do with the decision, which the government says was the result of a legal tendering process. Bollore Group has also denied any link between the communications consultancy and the port business.  ""As with all the proposals made by the opposition since the start of this legislature, we know that this could be abandoned in a desk drawer, but we are committed to clarifying this matter,"" opposition MP Gaoual Diallo said.

The alert comes after the Philippines watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), warned last month that salesmen, brokers, dealers or agents who promoted unauthorised investments such as Financial.org could face a fine and up to 21 years in prison. Regulators in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand have also placed Financial.org on alert lists of unauthorised firms with whom investors should exercise caution. ""The (UAE) authority warns investors against dealing with that website (Financial.org) and any services it is offering regarding financial products and investment portfolios,"" the Emirates Securities & Commodities Authority said in a statement. It added that Financial.org did not have permission to engage in financial transactions. Financial.org, a sponsor of British Formula One team Williams, could not immediately be reached for a comment via its website. Williams declined comment. Reuters reported in January that Financial.org is managing hundreds of thousands of dollars for Asian investors even though it is not licensed to engage in financial transactions. Financial.org, which describes itself as an education business, is not on a publicly available list of firms authorised and regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to buy and sell stocks or bonds for clients. Offering investment services without regulatory permission is a criminal offence in Britain. The FCA is conducting inquiries into the company’s activities, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters in March.

94,2018-05-02,Ancient Artifacts Seized From Hobby Lobby Returned to Iraq,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/us/ap-us-ancient-artifacts-hobby-lobby-news-guide.html,733," By The Associated Press OKLAHOMA CITY — Thousands of ancient clay tablets, seals and other Iraqi archaeological objects that were smuggled into the U.S. and shipped to the head of arts and crafts chain Hobby Lobby were returned to the Iraqi government on Wednesday. The Oklahoma City-based private company, whose devout Christian owners won a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court ruling exempting them from providing certain contraceptive coverage for employees, agreed to pay a $3 million fine last year to settle a lawsuit over the company's role in the smuggling of the artifacts, which authorities say were looted from the war-torn country. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Washington handed over the artifacts Wednesday to Iraq's ambassador to the U.S., Fareed Yasseen. ___ HOW DID HOBBY LOBBY ACQUIRE THE ARTIFACTS? Prosecutors say Steve Green, the president of the $4 billion company, agreed to buy more than 5,500 artifacts in 2010 for $1.6 million in a scheme that involved a number of middlemen and the use of phony or misleading invoices, shipping labels and other paperwork to slip the artifacts past U.S. customs agents. Ancient cuneiform tablets were labeled ""ceramic tiles,"" and items carried paperwork that said they came from Turkey or Israel. Prosecutors said artifacts were also deliberately undervalued with one shipping label listed 300 clay tiles valued at $1 each when they were actually clay bullae with a combined value of $84,120. Artifacts were also shipped in small batches to multiple addresses in Oklahoma City to avoid drawing the attention of customs agents, prosecutors said. A dealer based in the United Arab Emirates shipped packages containing artifacts to three different corporate addresses in Oklahoma City. Green financed the $500 million Museum of the Bible that opened in Washington in November. The museum includes pieces from the family's collection from the Dead Sea Scrolls and bronze gates inscribed with text from the Gutenberg Bible, but museum officials have said none of the artifacts involved in the case were ever part of its collection. ___ WHAT IS BEING RETURNED? The items include cuneiform tablets, cuneiform bricks and clay bullae, which are clay balls imprinted with a seal. Cuneiform is the wedge-shaped writing used thousands of years ago in Mesopotamia, the ""Cradle of Civilization"" between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now Iraq. Authorities say many of the tablets come from the ancient city of Irisagrig, a Sumerian city whose exact location is uncertain, and date from between 2100 B.C. and 1600 B.C. The tablets, some from the Old Babylonian period, are mostly legal and administrative documents but also include an important collection of Early Dynastic incantations and a bilingual religious text from the Neo-Babylonian period. Two clay cones are inscribed with royal inscriptions from the mid-third millennium B.C., and clay bullae include artifacts believed to be about 2,000 years old. ___ WHAT WAS HOBBY LOBBY'S EXPLANATION? Prosecutors say Hobby Lobby was warned by its own expert that acquiring antiquities from Iraq carried ""considerable risk"" because so many of the artifacts in circulation are stolen. But Green, who had been collecting ancient artifacts since 2009, pleaded naiveté in doing business with dealers in the Middle East. ""Early on, we were always trying to find the best experts we could to help us as we were acquiring antiquities,"" Green said in an Oct. 2017 interview with The Associated Press. ""And so as mistakes are made, we learn from those mistakes and put processes and procedures in place to try to improve on that. ... There's a lot of complexities in areas that I'm still a novice at. But we are engaging the best experts we can to advise and help us in that process."" Bob Murowchick, an assistant professor in archaeology and anthropology at Boston University, said that while the Hobby Lobby executive may have simply blundered, ""sometimes it's a deliberate smuggling attempt."" ""Most antiquities are not legally moved,"" Murowchick said. ""This stuff does not miraculously appear. In many, many cases it's illegally exported."" The selling of antiquities has become a major source of revenue for terrorist organizations, including Islamic State, and it is vital that collectors ask the right questions to avoid financing terrorism, Murowchick said.. ""It's a very formal business in some areas,"" Murowchick said. ""You collect things because you love them. Sometimes you don't ask the things that need to be asked."" Hobby Lobby did not immediately reply to an email seeking further comment Wednesday.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
95,2018-05-02,CDC Reports One Death From E. Coli Outbreak Linked to Romaine Lettuce,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/us/02reuters-usa-romaine.html,227," By Reuters (Reuters) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday one person from California died related to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine lettuce, providing an update on the multi-state outbreak of the disease. Twenty-three more people fell ill since the last update on April 27, bringing the total to 121 people from 25 states, the CDC said.  Three more states - Kentucky, Massachusetts and Utah- have reported cases, the CDC said in an email. Fifty-two people out of 102 with available information (or 51 percent) have been hospitalized, including 14 patients who developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. The reported strain of E. coli, which produces poisonous substances known as Shiga toxins, can cause severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting. The Food and Drug Administration said most people reported eating a salad at a restaurant, and romaine lettuce was the only common ingredient identified among the salads eaten. The restaurants reported using bagged, chopped romaine lettuce to make salads.  The FDA is continuing to investigate the source of the chopped romaine lettuce that caused these illnesses and has identified dozens of other fields as possible sources. The CDC reiterated its advice of not eating or buying romaine lettuce, normally used in salads, unless the source of the lettuce can be confirmed.

96,2018-05-02,Correction: On The Money-Expired Drugs Story,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/health/ap-us-med-on-the-money-expired-drugs.html,717," By The Associated Press TRENTON, N.J. — In a story May 2 about the use of drugs after their expiration dates, The Associated Press misspelled the last name of a source and omitted a hyphen in his group's name. His name is Michael Ganio of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, not Michael Gaino of the American Society of Healthsystem Pharmacists. A corrected version of the story is below: Pill expiration dates can have wiggle room if stored right Just how firm is the expiration date on your medicine bottle? There's probably some wiggle room. By LINDA A. JOHNSON AP Medical Writer TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Just how firm are expiration dates on bottles of allergy or pain pills? Probably not as crucial as the ""Best By"" date on milk cartons. Medicines are expensive, and amid occasional shortages, some people are tempted to use expired pills. After all, a pill good till May 31 can't be useless on June 1. The expiration date, typically just one or two years after manufacture, simply shows how long the maker tested the drug's stability by exposing it to extreme temperatures, humidity and light. Drugmakers propose the expiration period when they seek approval from regulators to sell it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises against using expired drugs, warning they may not work as intended or may be harmful, especially for people with serious ailments. Yet many people, including doctors, use medicines well after expiration. ""I think everybody does,"" said Dr. Jennifer Lowry, a toxicology expert at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Still, most expired medications get tossed. ""We probably are throwing away $60 to $70 billion a year,"" estimates Ajaz Hussain, president of the National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education. Hussain, a former FDA official, said he doesn't hesitate to take expired pills. Multiple medical groups have urged the FDA to lengthen expiration dates, but the federal agency said it's not sure it has authority to do so. The FDA does provide recommendations for drugmakers to do that voluntarily, but the companies have little financial incentive to do so. During acute shortages of some medicines, the FDA lets drugmakers extend dates if they have data indicating they're still good. That's happened with this year's shortage of saline solution for hospitals, for a seizure drug last year and during a 2013 shortage of Tamiflu. Numerous studies on expired, properly stored drugs, mostly pills, have found them fully potent or close, some many years after that date. In one case, unopened bottles of painkillers, antihistamines and other drugs from the 1960s were still very potent when tested a half-century later. The FDA and Department of Defense jointly run a program that periodically tests batches of antibiotics and other drugs in the national stockpile for potential disease epidemics and chemical attacks. That's repeatedly resulted in yearslong extensions, saving billions of dollars. Experts tell The Associated Press they know of no cases of patients harmed by taking expired medicines. The exceptions are aspirin and the antibiotic tetracycline, which can deteriorate soon after expiration dates. But it's hard for consumers to know what's safe and what's risky. ""A year out, I think you're perfectly OK to use the medications,"" said Dr. Ali Raja, an emergency medicine doctor at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. But experts say don't use expired liquid medicines, insulin and other injected drugs that must be refrigerated. They can break down faster than pills, especially if they aren't kept cold. Ditto for drugs not properly stored. Medicines kept in areas with high humidity or fluctuating temperatures — like a bathroom cabinet — or left in direct light degrade faster and can lose potency. Instead, keep them in a cool, dark place, advises Michael Ganio of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. Also, don't put different pills in one bottle, as the chemicals could interact. And don't use discolored, powdered or smelly pills, cloudy liquids or dried creams. What about EpiPens, the pricey emergency injectors people with severe allergies carry as a precaution? Their shelf life is about a year and a half. But multiple studies have shown their potency declines slowly unless they're exposed to heat or light. ""We know expired EpiPens can work,"" said Lowry. In a pinch, people should use them and then head to an emergency room, she said. ___    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
97,2018-05-02,Have We Passed the Acid Test?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/climate/climate-fwd-acid-rain.html,1201," Climate Fwd: By Henry Fountain and John Schwartz Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week: Do we still have an acid rain problem? Are electric cars really clean? And what’s been happening at the E.P.A.? By Henry Fountain You remember acid rain, right? The fight to protect forests, streams and lakes from the effects of what is now often referred to as acid deposition is one of the great environmental success stories in the United States and Western Europe. But acid rain is still a problem in some parts of the world, notably India and much of Asia. In case you’ve forgotten, acid rain is produced primarily by emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen from coal and other fossil-fuel-burning power plants and vehicles. The gases react with water vapor to form acids, which are washed out of the air by rain, snow, hail or even fog. The precipitation makes wetlands more acidic, which can be lethal for some fish. It also leaches aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic to both plants and aquatic organisms. The acidic water can also corrode stone buildings, sculptures and other objects. Acid rain can show up far from the source of the emissions, as the gases are transported by winds. In the United States, when the environmental impact of acid rain was first recognized as a problem in the 1960s and ’70s, scientists saw the effects in Northeastern forests, but traced the sulfur and nitrogen emissions to coal-fired plants in the Ohio Valley. The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 led to some emissions cuts, and amendments in 1990 mandated sharper reductions, especially of sulfur dioxide. The act has worked well, said Douglas A. Burns, a biogeochemist with the United States Geological Survey in Troy, N.Y. Rainwater in the Northeast has seen about a tenfold decrease in acidity since the 1970s, Dr. Burns said. “It’s a great example of an environmental problem where we studied it, we took some action, and the problem improved,” he said. Some impacts linger, however. Soils that acid rain has stripped of calcium ions, for example, take a long time to recover. The ions are eventually replenished through weathering of rocks. “We see the improvement, it’s just kind of slow,” Dr. Burns said. Western Europe, where the impact of acid rain was first observed in Scandinavia, has seen great improvements as well, also a result of tighter environmental laws. But elsewhere around the world the situation is mixed, Dr. Burns said. There have been improvements in some former Soviet bloc countries in Eastern Europe, notably the Czech Republic. “They had a horrible problem in the 1980s,” Dr. Burns said, but have made great progress since becoming independent in the 1990s. But China is only roughly where the United States and Europe were in the 1980s. “They seem to be just starting to bring it a little under control,” he said. China’s emissions have resulted in acid rain affecting its neighbors Japan and South Korea. Acid rain is still a big problem in India, where emissions are increasing, Dr. Burns said. The impacts include corrosion of the marble facade of the Taj Mahal in Agra. By John Schwartz We’re here to answer your questions about climate change. Send us yours via the form at the bottom of our climate Q. and A. Bhavya Sinha in Patna, India, asked us about electric cars: It’s true that in places where coal-fired power plants produce the biggest share of the electricity, the potential for electric cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is a serious question. A 2016 article in Scientific American argued that in coal-heavy places like Minnesota, driving electric might not be any better than driving a gasoline-powered vehicle. Nonetheless, there’s a strong case to be made that driving an electric vehicle produces fewer greenhouse gases than the average new gas-powered vehicle anywhere in the United States. That’s the conclusion of research published in 2015 by the Union of Concerned Scientists, and electric cars look even better in an update to the report released in March. The group performed a “well-to-wheels” analysis of what it takes to run the different types of vehicles, said David Reichmuth, an author of the study and senior engineer in the group’s clean vehicles program. The state-by-state variation is striking: To beat electric cars in Michigan, your gas vehicle would need to get 38 miles to the gallon. To beat electric cars in upstate New York, though, that gas car would have to do better than 191 m.p.g. Good luck with that. These issues are not just playing out across the United States. While comparisons can be difficult and the quality of data varies from country to country, it’s clear that driving an electric vehicle in a place like Norway, which produces energy almost entirely from renewable sources of power, is cleaner than running one in China, which is still heavily dependent on coal. Dr. Reichmuth noted, however, that China had committed to phase out coal over time, so with all countries, “it’s important to consider where they are going.” And, he added, “You don’t have to wait until the grid is perfect, you don’t have to wait until the cars are perfect, to go down that path.” A few things since we last spoke: Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, testified on Capitol Hill last Thursday, mostly about spending and ethics. He had an easier time than expected, though he is currently the subject of 11 federal investigations. (Our reporter Coral Davenport wrote an article for Times Insider about covering Mr. Pruitt.) So, Mr. Pruitt appeared to pass the test and still has his job. However, two of his top aides resigned Tuesday amid increased scrutiny. We also reported that Mr. Pruitt allowed a lobbyist friend to play an unusually influential role in setting his agenda during a visit in December to Morocco. That friend was then hired by the government of Morocco as a $40,000-a-month foreign agent. In addition, a different Washington consultant played a central role in attempting to set up a trip to Australia by Mr. Pruitt. (That trip did not happen.) Separately, California led a coalition in suing the Trump administration over car emission rules. The E.P.A. has been trying to loosen the rules by rolling back Obama administration regulations. But the California-led coalition is arguing that the E.P.A. is violating the Clean Air Act. We’d love your feedback on this newsletter.

98,2018-05-02,Trump Has All but Decided to Withdraw From Iran Nuclear Deal: Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/02/world/middleeast/02reuters-iran-nuclear-usa.html,716," By Reuters WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord by May 12 but exactly how he will do so remains unclear, two White House officials and a source familiar with the administration's internal debate said on Wednesday. There is a chance Trump might choose to keep the United States in the international pact under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, in part because of ""alliance maintenance"" with France and to save face for French President Emmanuel Macron, who met Trump last week and urged him to stay in, the source said. A decision by Trump to end U.S. sanctions relief would all but sink the agreement and could trigger a backlash by Iran, which could resume its nuclear arms program or ""punish"" U.S. allies in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon, diplomats said. Technically, Trump must decide by May 12 whether to renew ""waivers"" suspending some of the U.S. sanctions on Iran. One of the White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said it was possible Trump will end up with a decision that ""is not a full pullout"" but was unable to describe what that might look like. A presentation by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday about what he said was documentary evidence of Tehran's past nuclear arms program could give Trump a fresh argument to withdraw, even though U.N. inspectors say Iran has complied with the terms of the deal. Iran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses its arch-foe Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it. The pact between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - was among former U.S. President Barack Obama's signature foreign policies but has been described by Trump as ""one of the worst deals I have ever witnessed."" The White House official said Trump was ""most of the way there toward pulling out of the deal but he hasn't made the decision"" and that he ""seems poised to do it but until a decision is made by this president it is not final."" Top aides are not seeking aggressively to talk Trump out of withdrawal because he seems intent on it, a second White House official said. EUROPEANS LOSING HOPE Trump gave Britain, France and Germany a May 12 deadline to fix what he views as the deal's flaws - its failure to address Iran's ballistic missile program, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian sites, and ""sunset"" clauses under which some of its terms expire - or he will reimpose U.S. sanctions. While European officials continue to work toward such a ""fix,"" they believe the odds are against reaching one. One of the main sticking points has to do with the ""sunsets,"" where the United States in effect wishes to find a way to extend some of the limits on Iran's nuclear program beyond their expiration dates under the agreement.  The source familiar with the debate said U.S. negotiators are hamstrung by the fact that they do not really know where Trump's ""red line"" is and so they cannot tell the Europeans what would secure Trump's blessing. Trump could refuse to renew the waivers but give new U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo time to negotiate more with the Europeans, exploiting the deal's dispute resolution mechanism or the time before the most draconian sanctions take effect. Several sources familiar with the negotiations said that if Trump pulls out, a question for the Europeans will be whether this would be the start of a much harder U.S. line toward Iran, including military confrontation. ""The Europeans are not keen to be dragged into a regional conflict by the U.S.,"" said one source familiar with the talks. Two U.S. intelligence officials said they were particularly concerned about Iranian retaliation in harder-to-trace actions such as cyber attacks on the United States or its allies and attacks on soft targets by people without obvious ties to Tehran.  Such attacks are considered more likely than actions that might trigger a U.S. military response against Iranian nuclear and military targets.

State lawmakers passed a measure this week that would ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate by 2021 in an effort to protect coral reefs. Scientists have found the two substances can be toxic to coral, which are a vital part of the ocean ecosystem and a popular draw for tourists. Consumers would only be allowed to buy sunscreen with the chemicals if prescribed by a health care provider, though the measure itself doesn't ban online purchases or tourists from bringing their own to Hawaii. It would become the first state to enact a ban on the chemicals if Democratic Gov. David Ige signs the bill; he has not indicated whether he will. Similar legislation failed last year, after it pitted environmental scientists against businesses and trade groups that benefit from the $2 billion market for sun care products in the U.S. This is ""a first step to help our reef and protect it from deterioration,"" said Hawaii state senator Donna Mercado Kim, a fellow Democrat who introduced the measure. Although other factors contribute to reef degradation, ""hopefully, other jurisdictions will look at this legislation and follow suit."" ""This is the first real chance that local reefs have to recover,"" said Craig Downs, a scientist whose 2015 peer-reviewed study found oxybenzone was a threat to coral reefs. ""Lots of things kill coral reefs, but we know oxybenzone prevents them from coming back."" It also affects sea urchins and kills algae, a source of food for sea turtles, he said. He found as much as 14,000 tons of sunscreen lotion ends up in coral reefs annually. Opponents are skeptical of the science. ""What we're really concerned with is that there aren't very many independent studies out there that have gone for peer review,"" said Tina Yamaki, president of the Retail Merchants of Hawaii. She said the ban might discourage people from buying sunscreen products from local brick-and-mortar stores. The American Chemistry Council also opposed the bill, citing concerns over the dangers of sun exposure. ""It's a feel good measure,"" said Democrat Sharon Har, one of four lawmakers who voted against the bill. ""Yes, we must protect the environment -- it is our number one resource -- but at the end of the day, studies have pointed to global warming, human contact, coastal development"" as other significant threats to coral. Many manufacturers already sell ""reef-friendly"" sunscreens, and companies can deplete current inventory ahead of the ban in 2021, Downs said. Edgewell Personal Care, which makes Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen lotions, said it makes products free of the two chemicals. The company ""will continue to ensure we comply with all relevant regulations concerning oxybenzone and octinoxate."" ""We have so many problems with coral bleaching, and there is already so much contamination,"" said Dr. Yuanan Lu, a professor and director of the environmental health laboratory at the University of Hawaii, who applauded the passage. ""We have so many people who come to Hawaii, and some of the sunscreen ingredients can be toxic, harmful to marine systems.""    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
101,2018-05-03,Giuliani: Trump Repaid Cohen $130K for Payment to Porn Star,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/us/politics/ap-us-trump-porn-star-.html,1087," By The Associated Press WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump reimbursed his personal lawyer for $130,000 in hush money paid to a porn actress days before the 2016 presidential election, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys, said Wednesday, appearing to contradict the president's past claims that he didn't know the source of the money. During an appearance on Fox News Channel's ""Hannity,"" Giuliani said the money to repay Michael Cohen had been ""funneled ... through the law firm and the president repaid it."" Asked if Trump knew about the arrangement, Giuliani said: ""He didn't know about the specifics of it, as far as I know. But he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this, like I take care of things like this for my clients. I don't burden them with every single thing that comes along. These are busy people."" The comments appeared to contradict statements made by Trump several weeks ago, when he said he didn't know about the payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement she signed days before the presidential election. Giuliani later suggested to The Wall Street Journal that while Trump had repaid the $130,000, Cohen had settled the payment to Daniels without Trump's knowledge at the time. Guiliani's revelation seemed aimed at reducing the president's legal exposure. But outside experts said it raised a number of questions, including whether the money represented repayment of an undisclosed loan or could be seen as reimbursement for a campaign expenditure. Asked aboard Air Force One last month whether he knew about the payment, Trump said flatly: ""No."" Trump also said he didn't know why Cohen had made the payment or where he got the money. In a phone interview with ""Fox and Friends"" last week, however, Trump appeared to muddy the waters, saying that Cohen represented him in the ""crazy Stormy Daniels deal."" The White House referred questions to the president's personal legal team. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and ex-U.S. attorney who joined Trump's legal team last month, said the president had repaid Cohen over several months, indicating the payments continued through at least the presidential transition, if not into his presidency. He also said the payment ""is going to turn out to be perfectly legal"" because ""that money was not campaign money."" No debt to Cohen is listed on Trump's personal financial disclosure form, which was certified on June 16, 2017. Giuliani also described the payment to Daniels as ""a very regular thing for lawyers to do."" Daniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti, called the comment ""a stunning revelation."" ""Mr. Trump evidently has participated in a felony and there must be serious consequences for his conduct and his lies and deception to the American people,"" he said. Giuliani made the statements to Fox host Sean Hannity, who has his own connection to the case. It was recently revealed in court that Hannity is one of Cohen's clients. Hannity has described his personal dealings with Cohen as centered on real estate advice and said that it ""never rose to any level that I needed to tell anyone that I was asking him questions."" Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, says she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, months after his third wife gave birth to his youngest child, and was paid to keep quiet as part of a nondisclosure agreement she is now seeking to invalidate. She has also filed a defamation suit against Trump after he questioned a composite sketch she released of a man she says threatened her to stay quiet. The White House has said Trump denies having a relationship with Daniels. Cohen had said previously: ""Neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" He notably did not include the president personally. Asked about Cohen's denial, Giuliani said that he didn't know whether Cohen had made the payment without asking Trump but that he had ""no reason to dispute that."" The revelation from Giuliani came as Cohen was under escalating legal pressure. He is facing a criminal investigation in New York, and FBI agents raided his home and office several weeks ago seeking records about the nondisclosure agreement. Daniels' lawsuit over the hush deal has been delayed, with the judge citing the criminal investigation. The payment to Daniels has raised numerous legal questions, including whether it was an illegal campaign contribution and, now, loan. ""If this is true then it looks like Cohen may have made an unreported loan to the campaign rather than a contribution,"" said Richard L. Hasen, an expert in election law at the University of California, Irvine. He said that might be better for Cohen, but not for Trump, because it undermines the argument that Cohen was acting independently. ""The greatest significance is that it implicates the president directly,"" he said. Law firms advance expenses for clients as a matter of course, and so there's nothing inherently improper about a lawyer covering a particular payment and then being reimbursed for it. In this case, though, the client who apparently reimbursed the expense was running for president and the money was paid just days before the election, raising questions about whether Cohen's law practice was functioning as a vendor for the campaign and whether the expense was therefore an unreported campaign expenditure. If so, that could be legally problematic. Andrew Herman, an attorney specializing in campaign finance law at Miller & Chevalier, said Giuliani's argument that this was a private payment unrelated to the campaign appears to be ""pretty far-fetched"" given the timing — weeks before the election while Trump was under fire for his behavior with women and for an ""Access Hollywood"" tape in which he spoke of groping women without their consent. But if Cohen or Trump could establish that discussions with Daniels over the payment long predated his run for office, that could help them with the argument that the money was a personal rather than political expense. ""It obviously increases the president's exposure to potential campaign finance violations, but it also makes him look terrible,"" said Sol Wisenberg, a defense attorney who was a deputy independent counsel during the Starr special counsel investigation into President Bill Clinton. ""I don't understand the Giuliani strategy,"" he added. ""Maybe it's been too long since he's been in the criminal justice field."" ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller, Jonathan Lemire and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.

102,2018-05-03,Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Cohen for Stormy Daniels Hush Money,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels-giuliani.html,1351," By Michael D. Shear and Maggie Haberman WASHINGTON — President Trump reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime personal lawyer, for a $130,000 payment that Mr. Cohen has said he made to keep a pornographic film actress from going public before the 2016 election with her story about an affair with Mr. Trump, according to Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president’s lawyers. That statement, which Mr. Giuliani made Wednesday night on Fox News, contradicted the president, who has said he had no knowledge about any payment to the actress, Stephanie Clifford, to keep quiet before the election. [Read what Mr. Giuliani said here.] Asked specifically last month by reporters aboard Air Force One whether he knew about the payment, Mr. Trump said, “No,” and referred questions to Mr. Cohen. He was then asked, “Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?” “No,” Mr. Trump responded. “I don’t know.” In an interview with The New York Times shortly after his Fox News appearance, Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor and longtime Trump confidant who recently joined the president’s legal team, said that he had documentation showing that Mr. Trump had personally made the payment. Mr. Giuliani indicated that the goal was to conclusively demonstrate that there was no campaign finance violation involved. “That removes the campaign finance violation, and we have all the documentary proof for it,” he said. Mr. Giuliani added that when the initial payment was made, Mr. Cohen did it “on his own authority.” “Some time after the campaign is over, they set up a reimbursement, $35,000 a month, out of his personal family account,” Mr. Giuliani said. He added that over all, Mr. Cohen was paid $460,000 or $470,000 from Mr. Trump through those payments, which also included money for “incidental expenses” that he had incurred on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Mr. Giuliani said that he had spoken with the president before and after his interview on Fox News, and that Mr. Trump and other lawyers on the team were aware of what he would say. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that he paid a monthly retainer to Mr. Cohen, suggesting, as Mr. Giuliani had, that the payment to Ms. Clifford was not a campaign contribution. The president has repeatedly denied that he had an affair with Ms. Clifford, who has described having intimate contact with Mr. Trump before he became president. Mr. Giuliani’s comments are also in direct contrast to what Mr. Cohen has been saying for months — that he used his own money to pay Ms. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels. Mr. Cohen is under investigation by the F.B.I., which raided his home and office last month and seized documents that included information about the payment to Ms. Clifford. “They funneled through a law firm, and the president repaid it,” Mr. Giuliani told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. After Mr. Hannity asked for clarification, Mr. Giuliani insisted: “That was money that was paid by his lawyer. The president reimbursed that over the period of several months.” The source of the $130,000 payment is at the center of several legal disputes involving Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford. That includes whether the payment to Ms. Clifford was in effect a contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign aimed at preventing a negative article from surfacing just before Election Day. Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Cohen had “settled several problems for” Mr. Trump, and that the payment related to them. Another person familiar with the payment confirmed that that was the mechanism used to repay Mr. Cohen. Mr. Giuliani said that he was “not clear that” Mr. Trump was aware of the payment to Ms. Clifford at the time it was made, and he said that his understanding was that the president did not learn about the payment to her until recently. “I don’t think he did” know “until now,” Mr. Giuliani said. The comments on Fox sent a jolt through Washington and New York, including the legal teams working on behalf of the president, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who has sued Mr. Cohen in an attempt to be released from the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment in October 2016. Michael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, said Wednesday night on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani’s comments amounted to an admission that the president had lied to the American people about whether he was aware of the hush payment. “Mr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,” Mr. Avenatti wrote. “This followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America. We will not rest until justice is served.” In an interview, Mr. Avenatti said a key issue going forward would be how Mr. Trump accounted for any such payment and whether it was hidden in a way that could violate anti-money laundering statutes. Mr. Giuliani’s statement to Mr. Hannity was the latest of several contradictory narratives from Mr. Trump’s representatives about the deal to pay Ms. Clifford for her silence during the campaign, each of which have had potential implications for violating campaign finance disclosure laws. Mr. Cohen had previously provided a detailed account of how he had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket, drawing down on a home loan to do so. That opened Mr. Cohen and the Trump campaign to charges that he violated the law by exceeding the amount that an individual can donate to a presidential campaign. If Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, that could help Mr. Cohen and the campaign avoid prosecution for violating campaign contribution limits because a candidate is allowed to contribute an unlimited amount to his own campaign. According to a person close to the president, Mr. Trump reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the payment, a determination made in recent weeks by the president’s lawyers after examining banking records. The lawyers determined that campaign funds had not been used for the payment, the person said. The lawyers also concluded that the funds did not come from a third party or the Trump Organization, the person said. While the disclosure may be embarrassing for the president, his lawyers believe the payment did not violate campaign finance laws, the person said. Another person familiar with the payment to Mr. Cohen from Mr. Trump said the money was reimbursed in a series of payments, not in a lump sum. But such a payment from the candidate — even if it was made through a lawyer — would have to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as an in-kind contribution to the campaign and as an expenditure by the campaign, if it was for the purpose of influencing the election. Mr. Trump’s campaign did not disclose the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen on its commission reports. The crucial question in determining whether the reimbursement to Mr. Cohen violated campaign finance laws might be whether the payment was specifically intended to help Mr. Trump’s campaign. Paul S. Ryan, an official at the government watchdog group Common Cause, argued that “all the facts indicate that the payment was to influence the election.” Mr. Ryan asserted that Mr. Giuliani’s admission could allow prosecutors to make the case that Mr. Trump “knowingly caused his campaign committee to file an incomplete disclosure report with the F.E.C.” “Until tonight, it would have been tough to prove that because Donald Trump had denied knowing about the payment,” Mr. Ryan said. “But his reimbursement amounts to knowledge.” While most violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act’s disclosure provisions are misdemeanors, a knowing and willful violation could be a felony. But Mr. Giuliani’s comments could cloud Mr. Avenatti’s legal argument that his client should be formally released from the hush agreement she signed. When the president told reporters he knew nothing about the deal, he helped Ms. Clifford’s case that the hush agreement was not binding if Mr. Trump did not know about it and did not sign it. Though far from bringing clarity to the question, Mr. Giuliani obscured it further — now two lawyers for the president are providing two very different versions of events.

103,2018-05-03,Malaysia's Ex-PM Mahathir Under Investigation for Fake News,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/asia/ap-as-malaysia-fake-news.html,466," By The Associated Press KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysian former strongman Mahathir Mohamad, who heads an opposition alliance in next week's national elections, has brushed off concerns that he is under investigation for spreading false news. Kuala Lumpur police have said they are investigating Mahathir under a new law banning fake news after complaints over Mahathir's claim that his chartered plane was sabotaged last week to prevent him from filing his candidacy in the northern resort island of Langkawi. Mahathir, who was premier for 22 years until his retirement in 2003, said late Wednesday he isn't worried about the police probe. ""They can use whatever (law). I'm not afraid of any investigations. I have been investigated many number of times,"" he told reporters after a late-night rally in the central state of Pahang. The law, which was rushed through parliament last month just days before election was called, carries a stiff penalty of up to six years in jail and a fine of 500,000 ringgit ($128,000). Critics say it is aimed at silencing dissent ahead of the May 9 general election. On Monday, a Danish citizen became the first person to be convicted under the law for making false claims over the killing of a Hamas militant on a video he posted on YouTube. Mahathir, 92, has said he believed there was a ""deliberate attempt"" to stop him from going to Langkawi last Friday after the pilot found some damage to the jet just before departure. He said he tried to source for other planes but was rejected by three people, including one who claimed he was under pressure. Mahathir eventually found a plane and made it to the island to register Saturday for the polls. ""We are dealing with a government party which is known to use all kinds of tricks in order to win the election. And one of the tricks, of course, is to stop me from being nominated, and especially me, because I happened to be the leader of the opposition,"" he wrote on his blog. ""So I maintain my belief that the plane was deliberately tampered with to stop me from going to Langkawi."" The Civil Aviation Authority said its investigation found no evidence of sabotage and the private plane company said it was a technical issue related to the front wheel. Prime Minister Najib Razak slammed Mahathir for making irresponsible allegations and urged him to stop his ""politics of lying."" Mahathir made a political comeback amid anger over a massive corruption scandal involving the 1MDB state fund that was set up by Najib but accumulated billions in debts and is being investigated for money laundering in the U.S. and other countries. Mahathir has galvanized a fractured opposition and become their prime minister candidate, in the strongest bid to oust Najib and his long-ruling coalition.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
104,2018-05-03,UBS Seeks Regulatory Nod for 51 Percent Controlling Stake in China JV,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-ubs-group-china.html,188," By Reuters SHANGHAI/BEIJING — UBS Group is looking for a controlling stake in its China joint venture, UBS Securities Co, after the country's securities regulator announced new rules earlier this year easing restrictions on foreign ownership of brokerages.  UBS Securities has submitted an application to the regulator seeking approval for UBS to raise its stake in the JV to 51 percent, UBS said in an emailed statement on Thursday. It currently has about a 25 percent stake in the JV, UBS Securities' website shows. Previously, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of their Chinese securities JVs. The lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is reviewing UBS' application, the statement added. ""The further opening up of China's financial sector represents great opportunities for our China businesses, including investment banking, wealth management and asset management,"" a spokeswoman said in the statement. While restrictions have eased, some Western banks fear high asset-value requirements and limits to ownership by non-financial investors could stymie broad participation.

105,2018-05-03,Richemont Technology Chief Quits Amid Online Sales Push,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-richemont-cto.html,479," By Reuters ZURICH — Cartier-owner Richemont's technology chief Jean-Jacques Van Oosten is leaving after only four months in the job, during which the Swiss group bid for control of online retailer Yoox Net-A-Porter to boost web sales.  Richemont and luxury goods peers are seeking to ramp up e-commerce operations and attract younger shoppers, as online sales become one of the industry's fastest growth drivers. Richemont, which also owns watchmaker IWC and fashion label Chloe, hired Van Oosten for the newly-created technology role as part of this drive, alongside a former LVMH human resources director with a tech-savvy profile. Shortly after Van Oosten started in January, the group announced a 2.8 billion euro (2.5 billion pounds) bid for full control of Milan-based YNAP, putting the multi-brand retailer at the centre of its e-commerce efforts. The shifting backdrop at the company following Van Oosten's appointment was linked to his departure, a source close to the company said on Thursday, adding Richemont's focus on boosting its digital presence was unchanged.  Richemont declined to comment further on Van Oosten's exit, saying only the executive, who had previously worked at companies including Tesco and Unilever, was leaving for personal reasons. Over the last two years, the group has undergone a major management overhaul, replacing almost all of its brand heads, with new CEOs at watch brands Jaeger-LeCoultre and Baume & Mercier announced just last week. Also last week, Richemont nominated Alain Zimmermann, up to now CEO of its Baume & Mercier watch brand, to head e-commerce operations at the group's watch brands from June 1. Richemont did not say whether Van Oosten would be replaced. He was also a member of the now seven-strong senior executive committee that leads Richemont, which has abolished the role of group CEO. ""I presume Richemont will leverage Yoox Net-a-Porter's expertise to scale and internationalise its online and multichannel platforms, which was something Van Oosten was originally hired for,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said.  Luxury goods manufacturers have only belatedly pursued online growth, with many brands initially wary of an e-commerce world which they believed might make their products seem less exclusive.  But most are now playing catch-up, either building out their own websites where they can tightly control their image, or collaborating with third-parties sites such as Farfetch and MatchesFashion.  France's LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, opted to develop its own multi-brand platform, 24 Sevres, in one of its most eye-catching initiatives since hiring former Apple music executive Ian Rogers in 2015 as digital chief.  YNAP said in April it was launching a dedicated section for the sale of high-end jewellery - one of Richemont's fortes. One challenge for the two groups as YNAP moves in-house will be to hold onto other clients that collaborate with the platform.

106,2018-05-03,New Volkswagen CEO Vows Integrity Drive but Investors Unimpressed,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-volkswagen-agm.html,579," By Reuters BERLIN — Volkswagen's new chief executive on Thursday vowed to make the carmaker ""more honest"" as it fights to recover from 2015's diesel emissions scandal, but its wary investors called for outside vetting of steps to restore its reputation. Europe's largest automaker will expand its internal whistleblower system and beef up compliance to prevent the misconduct that triggered the scandal, CEO Herbert Diess said. ""Volkswagen has to become more honest, more open, more truthful,"" Diess said at VW's annual shareholder meeting. Preventing future malfeasance ""is the top priority for my colleagues on the (management) board and for me personally.""  Former chief executive Matthias Mueller, who was ousted last month by the carmaker's major shareholders, has said getting mid-level managers to adapt to the carmaker's post-dieselgate drive to improve accountability was more difficult than thought. ""We have too long underestimated the value of a more open corporate culture that does not repress dissent but instead rewards it,"" Diess said. Investors welcomed the planned changes but said home-grown steps alone would not suffice to credibly overhaul VW's corporate culture. Beyond a new code of conduct for employees and tighter rules for vehicle engineers, there has been ""little tangible progress (at VW) that credibly shows to investors that changes to the corporate culture are advancing,"" Michael Viehs of investment advisory firm Hermes EOS said. ""We therefore urgently recommend the supervisory board to carry out an independent assessment of corporate culture.""  Winfried Mathes of Deka Investment agreed. ""While the management board is getting the operating business back on course for the future, the company's corporate governance remains in the stone age. We still believe that a genuinely new start also requires a really independent supervisory board chairman."" Separately, Diess said VW had so far picked partners to provide battery cells and related technology worth around 40 billion euros (35.3 billion pounds) for its electric-car programme, four-fifths of the planned volume of 50 billion euros. The battery technology will be destined for Europe and China where VW sells 80 percent of its vehicles, while a supplier for North America has yet to be chosen, a source close to VW said. VW's huge battery buy contrasts with U.S. electric-car pioneer Tesla's struggle to convince investors it has enough cash to go the distance. Tesla on Wednesday posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss as it grappled with production issues on its Model 3 sedan. Diess on Thursday renewed his call on the industry to step up talks about jointly making battery cells in Europe as peers are pushing their electric-vehicle lineups. VW is still looking at whether to spin off assets such as motorcycle maker Ducati and transmissions maker Renk, Diess said, as the autos group strives to streamline its operations and become more efficient. Under former CEO Matthias Mueller, attempts to slim down the group by selling Ducati and Renk floundered amid opposition from labour leaders and the controlling Porsche and Piech families.  ""For non-core businesses such as Ducati, Renk and (large engines unit) MAN Diesel & Turbo, we will draw up sustainable future plans,"" Diess said. The deliberations could lead to expanding those businesses and developing growth strategies, but spin-offs ""are also conceivable"", he added. Since the former BMW executive took office on April 12, Volkswagen (VW) has announced steps to prepare its truck operations for a possible stock market listing and to reorganise its multiple car brands in an effort to boost synergies.

107,2018-05-03,A Fast-Food Problem: Where Have All the Teenagers Gone?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/upshot/fast-food-jobs-teenagers-shortage.html,1032," By Rachel Abrams and Robert Gebeloff A quarter-century ago, there were 56 teenagers in the labor force for every “limited service” restaurant — that is, the kind where you order at the counter. Today, there are fewer than half as many, which is a reflection both of teenagers’ decreasing work force participation and of the explosive growth in restaurants. But in an industry where cheap labor is an essential component in providing inexpensive food, a shortage of workers is changing the equation upon which fast-food places have long relied. This can be seen in rising wages, in a growth of incentives, and in the sometimes odd situations that business owners find themselves in. This is why Jeffrey Kaplow, for example, spends a lot of time working behind the counter in his Subway restaurant in Lower Manhattan. It’s not what he pictured himself doing, but he simply doesn’t have enough employees. Mr. Kaplow has tried everything he can think of to find workers, placing Craigslist ads, asking other franchisees for referrals, seeking to hire people from Subways that have closed. Yet there he was during a recent lunchtime rush, ringing up veggie footlongs and fountain drinks. He feared that if the line grew too long, people might get frustrated and not come back. “Every time there’s a huge line, the next day the store is nowhere near as busy,” he explained later as he straightened tables and swept up crumbs. Across the country, Keith Miller, another franchisee, is dealing with the same problem. “What employees? We don’t have them anymore,” joked Mr. Miller, who can’t find enough workers for the three Subways he owns in Northern California. Since 2010, fast-food jobs have grown nearly twice as fast as employment over all, contributing to the economic recovery. But rapid growth has created new problems. Some say restaurants have grown faster than demand, causing a glut of competition that is another source of pressure on business owners. Restaurant owners are also worrying about increased immigration enforcement: Nearly 20 percent of workers are foreign-born. With unemployment at a 17-year low, businesses everywhere are struggling to find workers. Fast food is feeling the pinch acutely, especially as one important source of workers has dried up. In 2000, about 45 percent of those between 16 and 19 had a job — today it’s 30 percent. “We used to get overwhelmed with the number of people wanting summer jobs,” Mr. Miller said, adding that he now gets maybe a handful of such applications, at most. “I don’t know what teenagers do all summer.” Gavin Poole, a 17-year-old senior at Montville Township High School in New Jersey, likes the idea of being his own boss — that’s one reason he created a small business out of after-school landscaping and handyman work. The money has helped cover his cellphone bill and the payments on the Jeep Wrangler he leased last year. “I want to be prepared for the future, because you don’t know, financially, what situation you could be in,” he said. A recent analysis by economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that an increased emphasis on education — and getting scholarships — had contributed to the decline in working teenagers, reflecting both the rising costs of education and the low wages most people that age can earn. Now, after years of benefiting from low-cost labor, many employers are starting to pay more. Fast-food wages began rising in 2014, and have increased faster than overall wages since. But at $10.93 an hour, the pay is still less than half the average for an hourly employee, pushing companies to offer more incentives — like dental insurance, sign-up bonuses and even travel reimbursement — to entice workers. That’s good news for workers like Juan Morales, who has assembled sandwiches at a Subway on Staten Island for more than 15 years. “It’s much better than before,” said Mr. Morales, who earns a little more than $15 an hour. “But for my boss, I see that it’s harder.” Restaurants are notorious for churning through employees. But people are coming and going faster than they have in recent memory, according to data from TDn2K, a restaurant research firm. Last year, the turnover rate reached 133 percent, meaning that positions often had to be filled more than once. That has forced business owners to adjust. Tamra Kennedy, who owns nine Taco John’s franchises in the Midwest, started offering $100 as a bonus to new employees who reached 100 hours. She has started offering merit increases twice a year, and she pays all employees more than the minimum wage. “Hiring has been more challenging in the last two years than probably the previous 10,” Ms. Kennedy said. About half of her stores are understaffed. So she has devised workarounds: Digital probes, not people, now record food temperatures. She has also invested in expensive new registers that can produce reports that employees used to do by hand. “I’ve never seen the industry in this kind of situation,” said Robert S. Goldin, a partner at the food consulting firm Pentallect. “It’s never been like this.” Labor costs are rising, according to an estimate from Dean Haskell, a partner at National Retail Concept Partners, a restaurant and retail consulting firm in Denver. Mr. Haskell analyzed public financial filings from 15 major chains and determined that those companies spent about $73 million more on labor last year than the year before. McDonald’s has announced that it will expand its tuition-reimbursement program, committing $150 million over five years to tuition reimbursement for employees who work at its stores for at least 90 days. Before, the requirement was nine months. That $150 million might seem like a lot. But replacing workers is also expensive: It costs about $2,000 to replace the average hourly restaurant worker, according to data from TDn2K. “Thirty years ago, I would not put up with the stuff I put up with today,” said John Motta, a longtime Dunkin’ Donuts franchisee in Nashua, N.H. When an employee recently missed a shift, one of his stores could serve only drive-through customers for about an hour. “You try not to be too harsh on them,” he said, “because you’re afraid tomorrow they’re not going to show up.”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
108,2018-05-03,Trump’s Solar Tariffs Cause a Scramble in the Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/business/energy-environment/solar-industry-tariffs.html,1184," By Ivan Penn SunPower is the nation’s No. 2 commercial solar-power company, employing thousands of workers directly and indirectly. But it makes most of its solar panels abroad, and with the tariffs recently imposed by President Trump costing it as much as $2 million a week, SunPower is fighting for an exemption. One of its rivals, SolarWorld Americas, produces panels domestically. Buffeted by foreign competition, it was behind the original push for the tariffs. Now the two American companies are merging. It’s all part of the disruption, distortion and uncertainty from an escalating trade offensive aimed primarily at China. In barely three months, the tariffs — the first shot fired by Mr. Trump in that campaign — are fundamentally reshaping the solar industry and its prospects. A Chinese player announced plans to open a factory in Florida as early as this fall. With its SolarWorld acquisition, SunPower moved to prevent further loss to its business by locating a bigger share of its production in the United States. Both companies are being hit with tariffs on high-efficiency panels they produce in Malaysia. Those efforts only blunt the negative effects of the industry fallout. While producing more panels in the United States will create a few hundred jobs, the tariffs could cost tens of thousands, largely on the installation side of the business. Dozens of solar companies are now petitioning to be exempted from the tariffs, and a bipartisan group in Congress has introduced a bill to overturn them altogether. “I think that any action that brings new investment to the United States is welcome,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But the tariffs have slowed down the growth of our industry. The growth has been muted, and that means jobs are not being created.” Her group said the tariffs could cost as many as 23,000 American jobs this year. In addition, the 30 percent tariffs are going to make it more expensive for cities across the country to pursue their goal of promoting solar power as a way to curb carbon pollution. The solar industry expects to continue adding installations, but growth is estimated to be about 11 percent lower than projections before the tariffs. Those diminished prospects are what prompted SunPower to bulk up its operations by pursuing the purchase of SolarWorld, based in Hillsboro, Ore. “We understand the goal of the American people and the goal of this administration,” said Tom Werner, SunPower’s chief executive. “We decided that we will be a leader, and we will take a bold move and buy an American enterprise.” The office of the United States trade representative, which is handling the tariffs, is reviewing the requests from SunPower and other companies for exemptions. No time frame for a decision has been set. To be excluded, the companies must show that they have a unique technology or offering. SunPower, based in San Jose, Calif., said its products served a need unmet by existing American manufacturers, and were made overseas for proximity to its suppliers, largely in Asia, making the solar panels cheaper. “We’re kind of collateral damage,” Mr. Werner said of the tariffs. The upheaval extends to the consumers of solar products, not just the makers. “The industry is in a scramble to figure out what all of the impacts are,” said Rob Freeman, chief executive of Tradewind Energy, which is based in Kansas outside Kansas City and develops industrial-scale solar and wind projects. “I think it’s fair to say it could be worse. I think it’s fair to say it’s a significant negative.” The effect of the tariffs on the cost of imported solar panels makes it more difficult to compete with other sources of power like wind, or even makes fossil-fuel plants look attractive again, Mr. Freeman said. “It tips it back in favor of other alternatives,” he added. And then there are the jobs. SunPower, which is taking over an operation with 280 employees, said it had not determined how many jobs it might add, the company said. JinkoSolar, a Shanghai company, announced this year that it would start manufacturing in Jacksonville, Fla., and create about 200 jobs. It already has a deal with Florida-based NextEra Energy to supply the parent company of Florida’s largest utility with seven million panels over four years — one of the largest orders to date. JinkoSolar said it still needed exclusion from the tariffs to bring any significant scale to its American operations. While it will assemble panels in the United States, the solar cells will continue to be produced in Asia and subject to tariffs. “We would not expand it if we don’t get allowed tariff-free cells,” said Nigel Cockroft, the company’s United States general manager. Even as those projects bring prospective jobs, the Solar Energy Industries Association pointed to the potential job losses from the suspension or termination of solar projects because of higher costs. It said domestic operations alone could not meet the previous level of demand. “In some ways, this is showing that the tariff is having some kind of effect, but it doesn’t necessarily grow the U.S. manufacturing market,” said MJ Shiao, global lead for renewables and emerging technologies at Wood Mackenzie, a research and consulting firm with United States headquarters in Houston. “The projects no longer pencil out,” Mr. Shiao said. Solar energy enjoyed a banner year in 2016, when there was a rush to get projects going before a federal tax credit on solar projects was to expire. In that year, it became the nation’s leading source of new electricity generation. But after that flurry, solar yielded its No. 1 spot even though Congress extended the 30 percent tax credit through 2019. Now the tariffs have added another bump in the road for solar power. Before the tariffs, the industry was expected to have the capacity to power 13.7 million homes nationwide by 2022, according to the solar industry group. That estimate has been revised downward by more than 10 percent. “There might be some places where solar would have won for new generation that now might revert back to wind or natural gas,” Mr. Shiao said. “In some cases nothing is going to fill that void.” Ms. Hopper of the industry group said she hoped that Congress would repeal the tariffs with a bill now before lawmakers. Representative Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, introduced the bill out of concern over the loss of jobs in her state. Two South Carolina Republicans, Representatives Mark Sanford and Ralph Norman, backed the legislation, citing not only jobs but also the added cost the tariffs imposed on business. The bipartisan nature of the effort gives the industry hope that it might find support. Solar power, which now generates almost 2 percent of the nation’s electricity, has become popular among Democrats and Republicans alike, as people consider ways to have more control over their energy use and to reduce pollution as well as create jobs. “We think that the industry will continue to grow,” Ms. Hopper said. “I think that the outlook is still positive but not quite as positive as it could be.”        Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
109,2018-05-03,Rukmini Callimachi on Audio’s Power to Reveal the Truth of the ‘Caliphate’,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/insider/rukmini-callimachi-caliphate-interview.html,2174," By Lara Takenaga Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. “Who are they?” This seemingly simple question drives “Caliphate,” The Times’s first documentary audio series, as Rukmini Callimachi, a foreign correspondent, searches for a deeper understanding of the Islamic State. “Caliphate” debuted in April, with Ms. Callimachi, who has covered Al Qaeda and ISIS for The Times since 2014, serving as its guide, deftly aided by the producer Andy Mills. Their 10-part series centers on the story of “Abu Huzayfah,” a former ISIS member living in Canada who, like many jihadists, uses a nom de guerre. The podcast complements “The ISIS Files,” Ms. Callimachi’s investigation into thousands of internal Islamic State documents that her team recovered from Iraq. New chapters of “Caliphate” are released every Thursday afternoon, and subscribers can listen a week early. I recently interviewed Ms. Callimachi about the challenges posed by reporting on ISIS for audio, the first episodes of the podcast and the ethical dilemmas of her beat. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. How has working with audio made you approach reporting differently? The big difference for me is that it’s very unusual and somewhat uncomfortable to write in the first person. This is something you do in exceptional circumstances when the reporter’s story is important as a vehicle for telling the larger story. When you’re doing audio, the fact that you’re the vehicle telling the story is built in. That makes it much easier to inform listeners about the reporting process. For example, last year, Andy and I were in Iraq for “The Daily” to report the story of young women who had just been released after three years of ISIS captivity and, in some instances, had been raped almost every day. In the middle of the day, we walked into the tent of two of the women and saw them collapsed, lying on mattresses. There were people wailing and crying over them. As soon as I saw that, I turned to Andy and said: “We’ve got to leave. We have no business being here. These people are really sick.” A lot of listeners commented on how powerful it was to hear that because they probably hadn’t thought about the ethical considerations that go into interviewing rape victims. In a text story, I might have described that there were two women who were collapsed, but the fact that I had to leave because it would have been obscene for me to try to interview them would not have gotten in. My beat is among the more unusual ones we have at The Times. It’s intense, and you’re dealing with these ethical quandaries all the time. My editors and I have many long discussions about how we do this and how we approach that. With audio you have the ability to be transparent about those considerations and walk listeners through how we struggle with and try to make our way through them. What do you see as the main advantages of audio over the written word? One of the subjects of the podcast is a young Canadian recruit to ISIS. If I were to pitch a text story based entirely on somebody identified by essentially his made-up name, that would be a hard sell. But with audio, you understand implicitly that this is his story. I don’t want to give away what happens later in the podcast, but there are some really emotional moments. You can hear the trauma in his voice and the emotion of him recalling what happened. There’s a point where he’s describing something particularly awful and we have the microphone very close to his face. You hear him rubbing his hand on his beard back and forth, and you understand that this is somebody who feels really distressed, really nervous. I could write that — “he rubbed his beard” — but it doesn’t come across the same way. I don’t want to diminish text in any way. That will always be my medium. But audio is a different form, so it has power in a different register. Many of the most popular serialized podcasts revolve around a single host who becomes part of the narrative. What went into the decision to feature both you and Andy? From the beginning we wanted to experiment with new ways of telling stories with this podcast. We got rid of the “host” role to provoke more spontaneity in our dialogue and hopefully more intimacy with our listeners. I loved working with Andy from the start. He comes from an evangelical background and grew up in a religious family, but later left the faith. He remains very curious about religion, and so much with ISIS involves faith and belief. We hit it off right away. It was really nice to have him as this sort of co-detective and be able to bounce things off him. Shortly after “Caliphate” debuted, it reached the top of the Apple Podcast chart. What elements do you think have made it resonate so strongly with listeners? One of the things is that Andy, in a way, gave me permission to really be myself and to be honest about what it’s like to be on this beat. I’ve always been worried about showing my vulnerabilities and telling people when I feel scared because, in the end, I’m a woman covering terrorism, and I just assume that there are people who think I can’t hack it. For example, when I was first telling Andy about the 911 call, I asked him to turn off the recorder. Later, he convinced me to put it on the record in Chapter 1. I really wrestled with it: Do I want people to know this insane thing I did — that I called 911 in the middle of the night because I thought ISIS might be ringing my doorbell? But I think Andy was right. Allowing myself to be human and to explain what it’s really like as a woman on this beat works, and is interesting for listeners. You frequently correspond with readers on Twitter and have invited listeners of “Caliphate” to direct message you. Based on their responses to the series, do you think you’ve reached a new audience? I really do, and that’s the exciting thing about audio. In journalism, at a certain point, you get into a lane and you get comments from people who are generally of that universe. I often get comments, for example, from journalism students, women, people who are interested in national security. Suddenly, I’m getting messages from people in Germany and in Finland who listened to the podcast, people whom I don’t normally hear from. That’s really cool. [Read this recent Twitter thread to see Ms. Callimachi’s responses to readers’ questions about her work covering ISIS.] In “Caliphate” you mention how previous interviews with ISIS members left you frustrated and made you question whether they were being truthful. Have you had similar feelings with Abu Huzayfah? I would have to spoil a lot of things if I answered that question. In general on this beat, though, that’s the puzzle you’re always dealing with. First of all, you’re spending so much effort just trying to get even one ISIS member to talk to you. It’s so hard to find them. You can somewhat get access to them in prisons in Iraq, but you don’t get much time with them. It’s also very hard to do these interviews in 20 minutes, 30 minutes because you’re just scratching the surface. And then you have a source’s story. Imagine how hard it has been to confirm the reporting on Harvey Weinstein, and that’s happening in Hollywood, a place with a paper trail and American citizens and people who speak the same language we do. It’s so hard with ISIS because you’re dealing with a place I cannot go: the caliphate, when it was around. So half the work is just getting the interview and the other half is figuring out if there’s any way to corroborate it. Have you been contacted by any law enforcement officials who are concerned that you’re communicating with a former ISIS member in Canada? A retired Canadian intelligence analyst started tweeting at me, basically asking if I had a moral responsibility to flag this person to authorities. Obviously, as journalists, we can’t act as an extension of law enforcement. That would be the end of me on this beat if I started turning in my sources. At the same time, we are dealing with members of a terrorist group — a group that has called for attacks in North America. You’ll see later in the podcast that we found a way to keep our journalistic integrity but also answer some of these questions. What are some of the other ethical dilemmas you’ve discussed? My goal in telling the story of Abu Huzayfah is to try to explain, in a way, the unexplainable: How does a normal-seeming person, who grew up in a middle-class family, with no abuse that I know of, loving parents and a comfortable lifestyle — how does that person, because there are so many of them, end up joining this murderous group? There’s a rut in the reporting on ISIS, where it’s so easy to write about the salacious, awful things they do. Very quickly, we go into this boogeyman narrative about these savage, brutal criminals. We forget that human beings are doing this, and 40,000 people have joined from overseas. Yes, you can find the psychopaths among them. But, in my experience, there are a lot more Huzayfahs than the others. I saw part of my job as trying to explain this story and trying to do so as humanely as I could. The line that we tread there is that we come very close to this big chasm on the other side, of justifying ISIS’ acts, which we don’t want to do, of course. There was a big balancing act on that front. On the podcast you talk about how ISIS members follow you and your work on social media. Do you know if they’re listening to “Caliphate”? So far I have not seen them talking about “Caliphate.” They did message each other about the “ISIS Files” story. There was a very long post in Arabic where they said that even The New York Times basically acknowledges their statehood, which was a little funny and a little worrying. Have you finished all the episodes? We’re still working on the back end, and I think we’re going to be working up to the wire. Do you know how “Caliphate” will end? I actually don’t, to be perfectly honest. I have an idea, but there are a couple of things that might happen in the middle of the podcast that I still haven’t gotten a handle on. Will the documents that you collected for “The ISIS Files” play a role in the series? They do. They’re featured heavily in episodes seven and eight. As one of the world’s foremost experts on the Islamic State and terrorism, have you learned anything unexpected in making “Caliphate”?  I have interviewed many victims who have seen beheadings and have been on the receiving end of the brutality of the Islamic State. To hear it told from the other side — in a really detailed, naked way — was revelatory. In the videos that ISIS has put out and in the reporting that we’ve done, you see the group as bloodthirsty and hateful, and that is one reality. But there are also other realities, including people who do these acts and who have enormous remorse. What would people be surprised to find out about your reporting process? When Andy was coming with me to Iraq, I was really worried because he thought he was joining this high-flying correspondent doing something really interesting. And I was thinking to myself: “He has no idea how many hours we’re going to be sitting at a checkpoint. He has no idea how many times we’re going to start the day thinking that we’ll get X, only to get to the destination and be told that the source has left.” There’s a lot of waiting around and trying to have tea with this official to get access to this one thing, trying to schmooze with that one person to see if, even though there’s a media blackout in Mosul, you could be the only journalist who’s let in. What comes next after “Caliphate”? I adore my little team. We’re already kind of nostalgic thinking about when this is over because we won’t see each other every day anymore. But we need to finish the podcast first, and afterward I think we all need to go on a really long vacation and then come back and think about it.

110,2018-05-03,Graphic-Stainless Steel Glut Builds in China as Indonesia Ups Output,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-stainless-glut-nickel.html,610," By Reuters LONDON — An abundance of stainless steel in China following the ramp up of new production in Indonesia is threatening stainless mills globally and the nickel producers that supply them. Marking a major structural shift, China, which makes and consumes around half of the world's stainless, became a marginal net importer of hot-rolled stainless coil in December for the first time in more than seven years, data from the International Steel Statistics Bureau and from consultants CRU showed. This is after Chinese-owned stainless giant Tsingshan started production last August at a giant plant in Indonesia that should, by the end of 2018, have an annual capacity of 3 million tonnes.This is equivalent to 6 percent of last year's global flat stainless capacity, CRU says, and there is more to come, with China's Delong Holdings set to start production at its Indonesian stainless plant in 2019.  Graphic: China's Net Stainless HRC Trade - https://reut.rs/2JMj4gi ""If we look at 2021 when we have Delong and Tsingshan fully ramped up, Indonesian capacity will rise to more than 5 million tonnes, that's just under 10 percent of global capacity,"" said CRU analyst Michael Finch. He added that Tsingshan, which has a captive power source and produces its own ferrochrome and nickel pig iron - key raw materials for stainless - is an ""incredibly low cost producer"". The plant sells most of its stainless to China, where stocks have risen 80 percent since the end of December, hitting their highest in more than eight years in mid-April, according to CRU. China's stainless prices have flatlined since mid-January at around 15,500 yuan a tonne. Stainless producers beyond China are also concerned. Finland's Outokumpu reported first quarter profits more than halving on falling prices and expects more of the same this quarter. Spain's Acerinox reported a drop of 40 percent in first quarter earnings, buffeted somewhat by solid U.S. earnings. In December, Handelsbanken downgraded Outokumpu citing the ""tremendously negative"" impact from low-cost capacity in Indonesia while Jefferies says weak Asian stainless markets are weighing on Acerinox in Europe and Africa.  Graphic: Acerinox, Outokumpu share price - https://reut.rs/2I6C4sN The weakness in the stainless market is also a worry for nickel producers <CMCU3>. Two-thirds of nickel demand comes from stainless mills. Benchmark London Metal Exchange nickel (LME) prices <CMNI3> rose 27 percent last year amid a ramp up in global stainless output and they are up some 10 percent this year at around $14,000 (10,290 pounds).  However, should stainless price weakness persist, mills, particularly those that are loss-making, could cut production.  ING said, even before operating costs are accounted for, Chinese mills are in the red as stainless prices since December have fallen below nickel prices <CMCU3>.  Graphic: China stainless versus LME nickel price - https://reut.rs/2JH3mmK The global nickel market is tight, explaining some of the price strength in nickel. The International Nickel Study Group last week nearly doubled its global nickel deficit forecast for 2018 to 117,000 tonnes. LME nickel stocks <MNI-STOCKS>, at their lowest since mid-2014 and Shanghai Futures Exchange nickel stocks near their lowest since November 2015, also illustrate the tightness. <SNI-TOTAL-W> Graphic: LME, ShFE nickel stocks - https://reut.rs/2IatvNN However, Chinese media reports say stainless mills are scrambling to combat the supply glut by bringing forward maintenance schedules or switching from stainless to carbon steelmaking. ""Nickel is our preferred short at these levels, we're forecasting below $13,000 by year-end,"" said ING analyst Oliver Nugent. ""While respecting the tightness, the price is up about 25 percent since December while stainless is dead flat, pointing at concerns that prices can't be passed onto the end consumer.""

111,2018-05-03,Italy's President Calls New Government Consultations on May 7,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/europe/03reuters-italy-politics.html,495," By Reuters ROME — President Sergio Mattarella has called for a fresh round of consultations with party leaders on May 7 to try to end nine weeks of increasingly fractious political deadlock following inconclusive March elections. Mattarella has already held two rounds of talks which failed to end the stalemate while two further efforts at mediation carried out by parliamentary speakers also hit a brick wall. ""After two months, the initial positions of the parties have not changed. No prospect has emerged for a government,"" the head of state's office said in a statement, adding that the president wanted to hear if party leaders had any other ideas. Mattarella's options are rapidly dwindling and the possibility of a return to the polls sometime between the coming autumn and next spring looks increasingly likely. A national election on March 4 saw a center-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant League winning the most seats and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerging as the biggest single party. The center-left Democratic Party (PD) came third. A matrix of criss-crossing vetoes has so far prevented the parties from agreeing to a coalition deal, with friction and frustration growing by the day. Underscoring the sense of paralysis, the PD was due to decide later on Thursday whether to open formal negotiations with 5-Star. However, Mattarella did not wait for their decision before announcing Monday's meetings - an acknowledgement that the deeply divided party will be unable to agree to such a deal. Having come to the same conclusion, the leader of the 5-Star this week called for an immediate revote in June, but a source in the president's office told Reuters on Wednesday that the head of state would reject this demand. Instead, Mattarella wants to put together a stopgap government to draw up a 2019 budget that has to be approved by the end of December. If party leaders fail to sign up to such an administration, which would almost certainly be led by a non-political figure, then a new vote would be held in the autumn - probably October. The last four Italian prime ministers took office thanks to backroom deals rather than ballot-box victories and repeated efforts to reform the electoral law that would allow for the swift formation of a government have failed to come up with a winning formula. While 5-Star is pushing for an immediate re-vote, other parties have suggested working together to devise a new election system. However, winning wide backing for such a pact in the current political climate looks highly unlikely. While Italy's day-to-day administration is being overseen by caretaker prime minister Paolo Gentiloni, latest economic forecasts from the European Commission have underlined the need for a fully empowered government ready to undertake reform. The forecasts showed that the Italian economy was set to grow 1.5 percent this year and just 1.2 percent next -- the lowest amongst the European Union's 27 member states.

112,2018-05-03,Expectations Grow for North Korea to Release Three Americans,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/asia/03reuters-northkorea-usa-prisoners.html,452," By Reuters WASHINGTON — CNN said on Thursday that North Korea would imminently release three Americans held as prisoners, as expectations grew that Pyongyang would make the gesture ahead of an unprecedented U.S.-North Korea summit due to take place in coming weeks. CNN, citing an unnamed source, said the groundwork for the move came two months ago when North Korea's foreign minister traveled to Sweden and proposed the idea. Rudy Giuliani, who joined President Donald Trump's legal team last month, told Fox News Channel that North Korea would release the three prisoners on Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, had direct knowledge of negotiations around the issue. Trump administration officials have pressed for the Americans' release as a show of goodwill by North Korea before the meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which is expected to take place in late May or early June.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she could not confirm details about the release, but she said Washington was ""cautiously optimistic"" about its ongoing talks with Pyongyang. ""Certainly, that would be an incredible step and certainly a sign of goodwill moving into the summit, moving into these discussions with North Korea. I can't comment any further at this point,"" Sanders said in an interview with Fox News. Asked about Giuliani's comment, a State Department official reiterated on Thursday that the department could not confirm whether the Americans were being released and was working to see them come home as soon as possible. In a Twitter post late on Wednesday, Trump said, ""As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!""  On Wednesday, South Korean media reports quoted a South Korean activist who said North Korea had moved the three Americans from a labor camp to a hotel on the outskirts of Pyongyang. A U.S. official said on Wednesday the U.S. government was looking into the reports. Speaking on condition of anonymity on Wednesday, the official said there was no immediate confirmation of any change in the detainees' status. Even as Washington presses for the release of the three, the parents of a U.S. college student who died last year soon after being release from captivity in North Korea have sued Pyongyang over their son's death, saying Otto Warmbier was ""brutally tortured and murdered."" Details of the location and date of the planned Trump-Kim meeting have not yet been announced, although Trump said on Tuesday that they may be announced soon.

113,2018-05-03,Texas Officials Ignore Dioxin Spread in Houston Waterways,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-harvey-silent-spills-dioxin.html,1697," By The Associated Press HIGHLANDS, Texas — Evelyn and Jerome Matula were still polka-dancing newlyweds in 1950 when they spotted a half-finished cottage in the woods along the San Jacinto River east of Houston. It seemed idyllic, with panoramic views and a sandy path to the river, where their three children and later their grandchildren fished. Now, the retired refinery worker and former educator fear their kin were poisoned by carcinogenic dioxin in the fish and well water. Decades ago, paper mill waste barged down the Houston Ship Channel was buried across the river. From their bluff today, the Matulas can see orange buoys marking a federal Superfund hazardous waste site established in 2008. An agreement announced last month has cleared the way for the San Jacinto Waste Pits to finally be cleaned up. But dioxin damage already has spread far beyond the waste pits, the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press found. More than 30 hotspots — small sites where dioxin has settled — have been located in sediments along the river, the Houston Ship Channel and into Galveston Bay, according to University of Houston research conducted from 2001 to 2011 and pieced together by the news organizations. The affected areas are alongside parks and residential neighborhoods with thousands of homes. But the residents' wells or yards have not been tested by state health officials. Details about the hotspots have not been made public by Texas environmental regulators, who used more than $5 million in federal money to pay for the research. In 2012, they ended a fact-finding committee that oversaw the project and had proposed new standards for dioxin and PCBs that could have been costly to corporate polluters. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality refused to release the full results of the studies that identified the sources of dioxin and PCBs, even to academic researchers, Harris County officials and lawyers who later sued companies over environmental damage. The research funding ended in 2011, leaving unanswered questions about whether toxic damage spread even farther during hurricanes Ike and Harvey. The university data linked hotspots primarily to three sources: the leaking waste pits, the original site of the paper mill in Pasadena and a major chemical complex in nearby Deer Park that is part of another Superfund site, records show. None has been cleaned up. Under the Clean Water Act and state law, Texas authorities were required to address dioxin and PCBs in the river and ship channel, waterways officially designated as ""impaired."" Setting such standards could have forced the responsible companies to clean up and upgrade contaminated stormwater and wastewater treatment. All three TCEQ commissioners, appointed by the governor, declined an interview request. Carl Masterson, a former Houston-Galveston Area Council staffer who for years served as a facilitator for the committee, said state regulators failed to do their duty. Once ""the meetings were done, the project was over and the findings were in, the TCEQ should have approved"" the committee's recommendations, he said. In a statement, the agency said it's still working on ""a document summarizing the source characterization of dioxin loads in the Houston Ship Channel/Upper Galveston Bay system."" The state's approach to dioxin follows the same pattern the Chronicle and AP previously identified in an investigation into air and water pollution releases from Hurricane Harvey. The news organizations found that state and federal regulators did little in response to massive releases of toxic pollution reported during and after Harvey's torrential rains. Similarly, Texas regulators have not followed up on the dioxin research with additional testing to see if wells, parks or property also are contaminated by the pollutants that formed the toxic hotspots. In the Matulas' case, their grandson Sean, a 33-year-old emergency manager, paid to have samples from the cottage's two wells tested after learning he suffers from long-hidden heart and kidney defects that may shorten his life. His mother had moved to the cottage when she was pregnant with him. Recent test results showed that the family well used at the time he was born tested at twice the level of dioxin considered healthy for human consumption. ""I have been told,"" Sean Matula said of conversations with his doctor, ""that I am lucky to be walking."" ___ LEAKING WASTE PITS The Texas Department of Health Services warned in 1990 that catfish and crabs in the San Jacinto and parts of upper Galveston Bay area contained so much dioxin that local seafood posed potential health risks — and banned its consumption by children and pregnant women. The Environmental Protection Agency already had been funding initiatives to clean up the nation's impaired rivers and identify sources of toxic substances in sediments and water that poisoned fish. The actions came in response to revelations in the 1980s that one of the most dangerous dioxin forms had been unleashed into the environment from paper bleaching and chemical manufacturing. Even in microscopic doses, those dioxin types have been linked to birth defects as well as cancer and reproductive problems. Some of the most likely sources were two former paper mills and the huge chemical complex in Deer Park. Then a state park employee discovered sand pits near a highway bridge where pulp from the larger paper mill in Pasadena had been barged in the 1960s, buried and forgotten. A video of the site taken around 2009 shows that fishermen and others had carved a path across unmarked sand pits partially submerged by the river. Particles of what looks like an egg carton were shearing off the shore into the water. Those crystalline fragments are examples of dioxin sediment, said Larry Koenig, who for 10 years was the TCEQ staff member assigned to the dioxin study. He and other experts have estimated that about half the waste originally buried in pits already had escaped into the environment before the site was rediscovered. Koenig retired in 2010, in part, he said, because of frustration over inaction on any proposed water quality standard. A dozen hotspots identified by teams of University of Houston researchers were scattered around those pits. Some of the worst hotspots became part of the San Jacinto Waste Pits Superfund site a decade ago. But others are miles downstream, near riverside neighborhoods in Baytown and LaPorte. Another source of hotspots was chemical plants along Patrick Bayou in Deer Park, according to the committee's reports and research. The bayou had been identified as a priority site for Superfund cleanup even before the state committee's dioxin water quality work began. The committee formed by state regulators to study dioxin included representatives of two companies ultimately found to be major contamination sources: Shell Chemical and OxyVinyls, a subsidiary of Occidental Chemical. By 2009, the corporate representatives, along with environmentalists and government officials, had reviewed proposed water quality standards for PCB and dioxin that could have sparked regulatory or legal action against their companies. Most of Patrick Bayou's dioxin and PCB pollution was from historic industrial activities. But Shell and Occidental Chemical would likely have faced pressure to address contaminated runoff, according to TCEQ documents, UH research, EPA records and Hanadi Rifai, the UH environmental engineering professor who oversaw the research teams. Representatives of OxyVinyls and Shell expressed no objections to proposed pollution-reduction reforms in public meetings, according to minutes and interviews. But EPA records show that during the time the dioxin cleanup committee was making its recommendations, neither company had agreed to pay to address polluted Patrick Bayou. EPA subsequently named Shell Chemical, Occidental Chemical and Lubrizol, all chemical companies with operations in Deer Park, as ""potentially responsible parties"", according to EPA records. The companies still have not agreed to fund the cleanup of Patrick Bayou, 16 years after the area was designated as a Superfund site. At the San Jacinto Waste Pits, federal officials said in April that International Paper Company and McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corporation had pledged to pay design costs for the plan to remove 161,000 tons of carcinogenic paper mill waste buried there in the 1960s. Ray Fisher, a Shell spokesman, said the company continues to collaborate ""with other relevant parties"" on the Patrick Bayou site, adding, ""Our focus is on safety of our people and community."" Eric Moses, an Occidental Chemical spokesman, said the company is working with others to complete investigation of the site ""and implement effective controls and remedies that will be protective of human health and the environment."" Both Shell and Occidental Chemical have acted more quickly to address dioxin and other pollutants at multiple Superfund sites in other states, EPA records show. ___ NO KNOWN THREAT? In 2012, the Texas Department of State Health Services delivered its public health assessment of dioxin in the waste pits. The report again warned of hazards posed to fish, but it dismissed the idea of contamination in neighborhoods' soil or well water. Rifai said UH's studies of river water and sediment could not be used to determine whether yards, parks or well water was safe. She is now working with the Galveston Bay Foundation, an independent nonprofit, and Harris County to conduct more testing after Harvey's flooding. The Matulas have two wells on the cottage property. For decades, they drank from the older, shallow well. About 10 years ago, they dug a deeper one. After Sean Matula paid for testing, he asked state health officials to review the complex lab reports. They found dioxin in the older well to be more than twice what the EPA considers dangerous for humans of any age to drink. Dioxin levels in the newer well represented an increased risk of cancer for children and adults but were within EPA's drinking water limits. Houston lawyer Richard Mithoff represents the Matulas and another 600 families. He says he believes he will be able to prove that cancer, birth defects and other ailments reported by many clients who lived around the pits are directly related to the dioxin in the river and its fish. The EPA cleanup of the waste pits won't undo damage done to those who lived there, Mithoff said, ""but it certainly holds great promise for the future and those living there now will be able to rest a little easier."" ___ Frank Bajak of The Associated Press contributed to this report.

114,2018-05-03,Trump Says Campaign Funds Were Not Used to Pay Adult-Film Star,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/us/politics/03reuters-usa-trump-daniels.html,740," By Reuters WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said on Thursday his personal lawyer was paid back through a monthly retainer, not campaign funds, for the $130,000 given to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to stop ""false and extortionist accusations"" she made about a sexual encounter with him. Trump, who in April told reporters he did not know about the payment to Daniels made by his lawyer Michael Cohen the month before the 2016 election or the source of the money, said on Twitter the funds were part of a ""private agreement"" that involved money that had ""nothing to do with the campaign.""  In his fullest account to date regarding the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, Trump acknowledged the non-disclosure agreement with her to secure her silence about what she has called a one-night sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. Trump also forcefully denied the affair. ""The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair ... despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair,"" Trump wrote, adding that Daniels and her lawyer had violated it. ""Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll (sic) in this transaction,"" Trump added. The claim of repayment is significant because a payment by Cohen could be seen as an illegal campaign contribution. Trump as candidate would have been permitted to make unlimited personal contributions to his own campaign. Cohen is currently facing a federal criminal investigation in New York in part over the payment to Daniels, with the FBI seizing material from his office and home. The investigation is an offshoot of the ongoing probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia and whether Trump has unlawfully sought to obstruct the probe. Trump on Thursday said Cohen ""received a monthly retainer"" from which he entered into the ""non-disclosure agreement."" Trump described such agreements as ""very common among celebrities and people of wealth."" Trump's tweets came the morning after former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joined Trump's legal team last month, said Trump had repaid Cohen the hush money given to Daniels. Even if Trump repaid Cohen, the payment to Daniels could still be found to be an undisclosed campaign loan in violation of federal election laws, law professor Kathleen Clark of Washington University in St. Louis said. Clark said Giuliani's statement strongly suggests the payment could have been campaign-related. Omitting the loan from disclosure forms is also arguably a violation of statutes against making false statements to the government, she said. 'HE DID HIS JOB' Giuliani pushed back on that idea on Thursday on the Fox News program ""Fox & Friends,"" saying it was a personal rather than campaign matter to protect the president's family and that Trump did not know the details of the arrangement until about 10 days ago. But Giuliani also appeared to make the opposing argument. ""Imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton ... Cohen made it go away. He did his job,"" said Giuliani, referring to Trump's election opponent. Daniels has filed two lawsuits against Trump, one to get out of a non-disclosure agreement she had signed in October 2016 ahead of the November presidential election in exchange for the $130,000, and another for defamation. The lawsuit over the non-disclosure agreement was put on hold last week by a judge in Los Angeles, who said the potential overlap between the case and the criminal investigation in New York could violate Cohen's constitutional right against self-incrimination. Asked about the president's tweets, Daniels' lawyer Michael Avenatti told MSNBC Trump opened himself up to another possible defamation suit.  ""Our case just got exponentially better,"" Avenatti said. ""This is not about sex ... this is about a cover up."" Daniels offered her account of her relationship with Trump in an interview on the CBS News program ""60 Minutes"" broadcast in March. Avenatti has said that appearance did not violate the agreement because Trump never signed the contract.  Separately, Giuliani told the Washington Post that he understood that Cohen's reimbursement from Trump was made in a series of transactions after the 2016 election that were completed in 2017 - during his presidency - but could have continued into this year.

115,2018-05-03,"Teva Reports Jump in First-Quarter Earnings, Raises Guidance",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-teva.html,460," By The Associated Press JERUSALEM — Israeli generic drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries on Thursday said first-quarter earnings surged over 80 percent and raised its outlook for the rest of the year, citing progress in an aggressive restructuring plan. Teva said it posted net income of $1.06 billion, or $1.03 a share, compared to $580 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings came despite a 10 percent drop in sales. ""2018 is off to a solid start,"" Chief Executive Kare Schultz said in a statement. ""Our strong first quarter performance, along with our confidence in executing the restructuring program, gives us a solid foundation to raise our guidance for the year."" Teva, the world's No. 1 generic drugmaker, has been hit hard by price pressure and competition in its core generic business, the loss of patent protection on its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and a more than $30 billion debt load stemming from its acquisition of the generics business of Allergan. The struggling company announced plans in December to cut 14,000 jobs, over one quarter of its global work force. Schultz, who joined Teva last fall, said the restructuring plan is going well. He said the company has already eliminated over 6,000 jobs and managed to reduce its debt load to below the $30 billion mark. He said the company has a ""good balance"" of new generic products hitting the market as older ones come off line. He also said sales of Austedo, a new proprietary drug for movement disorders like Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia, are continuing to grow. A second proprietary drug, the migraine treatment fremanezumab, is expected to hit the U.S. market by the end of the year, after suffering delays due to manufacturing problems, and be introduced in Europe next year. In light of the progress, Teva raised its 2018 revenue outlook to $18.5 to $19 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $18.3 to $18.8 billion. Despite the signs of progress, Teva said its first-quarter sales slumped 10 percent to $5.065 billion from $5.65 billion a year earlier. It cited continued price pressure on its generic business, generic competition to Copaxone and the shedding of some noncore businesses. After opening higher, Teva shares were down 15 cents at $18.45 in late-morning trading on Wall Street. With roots going back more than a century, Teva has grown into a major global player over the past 40 years with a series of acquisitions, and by developing original drugs and leading the move toward cost-saving generic medications. Its successes over the years are a source of pride in Israel. The layoff plans triggered protests at Teva plants in Israel and prompted talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But after talks with the unions, protests have died down.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
116,2018-05-03,EU Food Safety Body Tells States to Keep Eye Out for Insecticide After Scare,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-europe-eggs.html,190," By Reuters BRUSSELS — The European Union's food safety watchdog urged member states on Thursday to monitor poultry products for the incecticide fipronil following the withdrawal of millions of chicken eggs from supermarket shelves last year. The Parma-based EFSA tested some 5,500 samples of eggs and chicken meat between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30 of last year and found that about one in seven contained levels of fipronil exceeding the legal limit. ""It is recommended that fipronil and other acaricides be included in the future monitoring activities of the member states,"" EFSA said in a report. Eight countries had submitted samples with elevated fipronil concentrations, including Italy, Germany and France, EFSA said. Fipronil is commonly used to treat pets for fleas and ticks but is banned from use in the food chain because it may cause organ damage in humans if large quantities are ingested. After a fipronil scandal broke last summer, Dutch authorities identified the source as a small supplier of cleaning products that had sold them to unwitting producers as a more efficient way to fend off red mites in poultry stables.

117,2018-05-03,"Airbnb Drives Up Rent Costs in Manhattan and Brooklyn, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/nyregion/airbnb-rent-manhattan-brooklyn.html,962," By Luis Ferré-Sadurní Airbnb’s growing influence caused rents to increase significantly in tourist areas and gentrifying neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where the majority of the company’s rentals are concentrated, according to a report released on Thursday by the city comptroller’s office. In Manhattan’s Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea neighborhoods and the Midtown Business District, which accounted for about 11 percent of all Airbnb listings in New York City in 2016, average monthly rents increased by $398 between 2009 and 2016, of which $86, or 21.6 percent, was a result of Airbnb’s presence, the report said. In Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, the study said, rents went up 18.6 percent in those years because of Airbnb listings. Airbnb makes it easy to rent apartments to tourists, taking units off the market for full-time residents, the report said. “For years, New Yorkers have felt the burden of rents that go nowhere but up, and Airbnb is one reason why,” the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, said in an interview. “It’s just simply supply and demand. Fewer apartments to rent means higher prices, and that’s the Airbnb effect.” The report said that Airbnb’s influence cost New Yorkers $616 million in additional rent in 2016 as a result of price pressures. [Read the report.] Airbnb has more than 50,000 apartment listings in New York City, the company’s largest market in the United States. The comptroller’s report shed light on the clash of the so-called sharing economy with city neighborhoods struggling to preserve their stock of affordable housing and rein in skyrocketing rents, though the report also found that the online rental site had a negligible effect on most neighborhoods outside of Manhattan and Brooklyn, where listings are sparse. The study drew on data scraped from Airbnb listings and used regression analysis to compare what rents would have been across 55 neighborhoods if thousands of units had not been listed on the home-sharing website. Still, the report has limitations: An apartment listed on Airbnb does not always translate into a unit lost in the long-term rental market, because apartments may be rented for a short amount of time a year. Airbnb officials said the report confused causation with correlation by blaming the company for higher rents that could have been raised by other factors, like rezoning. However, the comptroller’s study included variables like household income, population, and employment rates. “Comptroller Stringer’s report severely misrepresents the impact of our platform on housing and is full of elementary methodological mistakes,” said Andrew Kalloch, a policy manager at Airbnb. “New Yorkers deserve better from their chief financial officer.” Mr. Stringer said in response, “The methodology is sound.” Mr. Kalloch said Airbnb’s effect on rents was insignificant because listings represent less than 1 percent of apartments in the city. But he acknowledged that some neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of Airbnb rentals. He also said that using 2009 as a starting point distorts the findings because rents in New York tanked during the Great Recession that year. Most New Yorkers, Mr. Kalloch said, use Airbnb as a source of extra income to make ends meet and that entire apartments are rented for a median of 60 nights a year. But Airbnb has long been scrutinized by officials because some landlords use Airbnb to effectively run illegal hotels in residential buildings. And some New York tenants use the platform to rent spare bedrooms to travelers year-round, often in violation of housing rules or without the permission of their landlords. One Airbnb host in Chelsea, a 45-year-old singer and songwriter from California, has rented a room in a two-bedroom apartment for more than three years to tourists who stay an average of four to five nights. The singer spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of being evicted. The singer charges $40 to $110 per night during the summer, which helps cover the $3,050 monthly rent. “It’s a great way to make money,” the singer said. “I get to keep my apartment clean for guests and meet new people in a world where everyone is disconnected.” However, many tenant advocacy groups say that Airbnb increasingly displaces low-income New Yorkers and welcomes unruly neighbors into their buildings. “It really isn’t a good idea to turn our residential housing into illegal hotels so that a $30 billion company can get their I.P.O.,” said Tom Cayler, a member of the West Side Neighborhood Alliance, a coalition of tenants who advocate for the preservation of affordable housing. As in other areas around the world, Airbnb has had a contentious history in New York. In 2014, about three-quarters of all Airbnb rentals in the city were found to be illegal, according to a report released that year by the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. Under state law, it is illegal in most buildings to rent an apartment for fewer than 30 days unless the owner is present when a guest is renting. But some tenants and landlords skirt the law and rent out entire apartments for shorter amounts of time without being present, the report said. The attorney general’s report said Airbnb was dominated by operators with multiple listings, finding that 6 percent of the hosts made 37 percent of the revenue — or $168 million. The company said it had already expelled thousands of commercial operators from its platform. In 2016, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed a bill allowing hosts to be fined up to $7,500 for listing apartments that violate housing regulations. Despite the ongoing feud with New York officials, Mr. Kalloch said his company welcomed certain regulations to rid its platform of abusers. “Along with proactively removing bad actors from our platform,” he said, “Airbnb is supporting legislation in Albany that would provide for rigorous enforcement against illegal hotel operators, among other things.”      Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
118,2018-05-03,Exxon Pushes Ahead With Rosneft LNG Project Despite Sanctions-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-exxon-rosneft-far-east-lng.html,504," By Reuters BEIJING/LONDON — Exxon Mobil is pushing ahead with efforts to develop its $15 billion (11 billion pound) Far East Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project with Russia's Rosneft despite being forced to exit some joint ventures due to Western sanctions. Two months ago Exxon invited companies including China National Petroleum Corporation's engineering arm to bid for construction contracts by October, sources with knowledge of the matter said.  A final investment decision is due in 2019, they said. The project is being jointly developed with Rosneft using gas from the Sakhalin-1 venture which will be chilled into liquid to underpin the LNG plant's initial annual output target of 6 million tonnes. Western sanctions forced Exxon to exit some joint ventures with Rosneft in late February, but LNG is not part of the sanctions. The Russian company said the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas production-sharing JV struck in the mid-1990s. ""The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetise Sakhalin-1 gas resources,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said. ""A liquefied natural gas plant is an option to maximise benefits to the consortium and the Russian state and its citizens,"" she added. Exxon-Rosneft have also held discussions about feeding gas from Sakhalin-1 fields into a planned third production unit at an existing LNG plant run by Gazprom on Sakhalin Island, industry sources said. Rosneft was not available for immediate comment. Exxon's LNG footprint is expanding rapidly with major new projects planned in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea and the United States as demand in China and Southeast Asia booms.  Gas accounted for 43 percent of Exxon output last year, according to BMO Capital Markets, a share set to rise as new LNG projects start up. CHINESE UP LNG PROJECT WORK CNPC's Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp is preparing to bid for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts for Far East LNG's supporting facilities, such as storage tanks, pipelines and utilities, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Chinese engineering companies, banks and shipyards are all muscling into LNG, typically the preserve of Western, Japanese and South Korean players, as government coal-to-gas switching policies make LNG an increasingly strategic fuel.  For example, Chinese investment is pouring into African floating LNG projects, import terminals, tankers and traditional land-based plants such as the $12 billion invested in Russia's Yamal facility, used to skirt Western sanctions.  Loans in turn drum up business for Chinese engineering firms and shipyards in LNG, and give state-backed companies the upper hand in supply negotiations. It is unclear if Chinese lenders will help finance Far East LNG.  The bid deadline for EPC contractors is September 30, sources said.  A consortium of Japan's JGC and Texas-headquartered Fluor Corp will handle the core work of project managing and building the liquefaction trains and other key components, industry sources said.  JGC was not available for immediate comment and Fluor declined to comment.

120,2018-05-03,Belt-Tightening Demands Put Tunisia’s Democracy at Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/world/middleeast/tunisia-democracy-economy-reform.html,1583," By Borzou Daragahi TUNIS — When Tunisians rose up against their longtime ruler seven years ago, a pair of idealistic young teachers joined in, hoping the protests would usher their North African nation of 10 million into the ranks of the world’s democracies. But today Adel and Marwa Jaafri are struggling financially as the country’s economy sputters, its currency falters and the government imposes fresh belt-tightening measures. Mr. Jaafri, 35, a high school computer science teacher, recently took a second job installing satellite dishes and moonlights fixing computers. “I still can’t afford my life,” he said. “We are just making it, but we have taken out a lot of loans. Everything is more expensive — food, schoolbooks for the children.” Ms. Jaafri, 34, a university professor of computer programming, finished his lament: “Clothes, shoes for the kids. Of course we’re worried. We’re struggling.” Tunisia, often hailed as the sole success story of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is in danger of being crippled by budget-cutting economic policies that critics say are imperiling the country’s democratic experiment. Scholars and economists have warned for years that Tunisia’s economic problems could thwart its political progress. But now a raft of critics are blaming financial measures promoted by international lenders and advisers, and taken up by inexperienced Tunisian politicians, for making them worse and setting off an economic and political crisis. “When you impoverish the poor and middle class you undermine democracy,” said Jihen Chandoul, an economist and co-founder of the Tunisian Observatory of Economy, a research institute. “What’s hurting the democratic process are austerity measures we’ve been asked to implement to access loans. Tunisian democracy is in danger.” It is a pattern that has played out around the world, in Latin America, Asia and recently Greece, as the International Monetary Fund and other Western lenders demand that governments balance their budgets and open their economies. Those policies often produce jarring hardship and political upheaval that can undermine support for the very kind of democratic and capitalist systems the West is trying to build. In Tunisia, where the Arab Spring began, those measures are doubly biting for a people who had harbored such great hopes for a fairer society in one of the Arab world’s few democracies. Protests against higher taxes and rising prices broke out across the country in January after new economic policies advocated by the I.M.F. and Tunisia’s Western sponsors took effect. Following their guidance, Tunisia slashed the budget deficit at the expense of popular demands for jobs, adopted free trade policies that may hurt Tunisian producers and allowed a devaluation of the currency that has raised food and fuel prices. Tunisian economists, activists, and politicians cited a dozen more examples of what they described as free-market-style economic prescriptions that have worsened people’s lives and damaged faith in the nascent democracy. One test of that faith may come Sunday, when Tunisians head to the polls for the first municipal elections since the 2010 uprising. Tunisia is in poor economic shape. Its gross domestic product is growing at a tepid 2 percent, while unemployment remains at 15.5 percent, and about 30 percent among the young, many of whom while away their days smoking water pipes at cafes with little hope of being able to move out of their parents’ homes. The Tunisian dinar has fallen about 40 percent compared to the euro and the dollar since 2011, increasing prices for fuel and almost all consumer goods. International ratings agencies have repeatedly lowered Tunisia’s creditworthiness, straining the government’s ability to borrow to invest in jobs or public works programs. According to a poll conducted late last year by the International Republican Institute, a Washington democracy advocacy organization, 83 percent of Tunisians say the country is going in the wrong direction, with 64 percent citing the economy or unemployment as their biggest worry. Tunisian political leaders say they had few options but to submit to demands by international lenders, including the European Union and the I.M.F., to whom they owed $31 billion, equivalent to 60 percent of the G.D.P. “We have no choice,” Naoufel Jammali, a lawmaker of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda Party and a former cabinet minister. “We have to strengthen our ties with the international institutions which advise us to take these steps. Everyone keeps talking about a new economic model, but we have no idea how to create a new model.” Politicians attribute the economic hardships to the lingering aftereffects of the global financial meltdown a decade ago as well as troubles in neighboring Libya, an oil-rich behemoth that once provided jobs, businesses and remittances but that is now a source of security threats, including terrorist attacks that have damaged Tunisia’s tourism industry. They also blame political infighting in Parliament and the street protests, factors that would have been easier to suppress under the dictatorship. In February, Parliament exploded into shouting matches over the process for naming a new central bank governor. “Before there was always one strong boss to make decisions,” said Mohamed Saidane, a lawmaker and member of the secular Nidaa Tounes party. “Now, we’re changing. There are 270 deputies and 25 parties and no one has a majority. The electoral system is slowing down the economy.” But others pinpoint specific decisions made by the country’s leaders at the behest of the monetary fund and other Western powers that have worsened Tunisia’s problems. Last year the I.M.F. delayed a loan disbursement because it said the government wasn’t moving fast enough to sell off three banks and slash government jobs. It also coaxed Tunisia into adopting higher sales tax rates in an effort to reduce the 2018 budget deficit. Tunisians were stunned when the fund’s Tunisia mission chief, Bjorn Rother, told Bloomberg last month that the dinar should fall even lower, a sentiment that baffled economists who worry that consumers are already suffering under soaring fuel and food costs and that the government is squeezed by debt payments denominated in dollars and euros. A Tunisian business website marveled, “Does Bjorn Rother want to kill the Tunisian economy?” The monetary fund, which was roundly criticized in the 1980s and 1990s for imposing painful structural adjustments on developing countries, insists that it is not promoting austerity in Tunisia. “We advocate well designed, well implemented, socially balanced reforms,” the fund’s spokesman, Gerry Rice, said. “Jobs and fairness will come with economic growth.” In a question-and-answer page posted on the organization’s website in response to the criticism, the I.M.F. said the government could reduce debt without hurting the poor, for example by reducing subsidies on products consumed mostly by the affluent and strengthening tax collection, and channeling those resources to job creation and social spending. Allowing Tunisia’s currency to fall, the fund’s defenders say, will jump-start Tunisian industries such as textiles, which are now challenged by imports from China and Turkey. But the monetary fund says it is ultimately the government that calls the shots on the country’s economic direction. This year, the European Parliament dealt a further blow to Tunisia’s investment prospects, listing the country as a haven for money laundering and tax-dodging, a move considered unfair even by some Western politicians. “I can’t understand how you can put Tunisia in the same basket” as Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen, said Marie-Christine Vergiat, a French member of the European Parliament. Some politicians suggested the blacklisting was meant to press Tunisia into signing a controversial free trade agreement with Europe that Tunisians worry would further damage prospects for embattled local producers.“They’re using their weight in the E.U. to increase economic integration,” said Mr. Jammali, the lawmaker. “But it’s really a David-and-Goliath situation. We are negotiating with a huge power.” Economic strains on ordinary Tunisians can be seen at any secondhand clothing market in Tunis, the capital. The sprawling flea markets known as “fripes” used to draw the poor and the young, as well as a smattering of vintage clothing aficionados. Now middle-aged and middle-class families depend on them, and complain that even there prices have jumped. A jacket that used to cost the equivalent of $3 now costs more than $8. During a recent visit, buyers and sellers recalled that life was easier, costs lower and profit margins higher under the deposed strongman, Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali. “We no longer buy new things, and even the fripe has gotten more expensive,” said Tawfiq Jendoubi, a 29-year-old employee at a grocery store. “I’m realizing now that everything here is too expensive. I cannot afford any of it.” The Jaafri family struggles to get by on a combined income of about $15,000 a year. After paying rent, school fees and debts, the family of five is left with about $13 a day for food, transportation, clothes and any extras. “We’re not able to save anything,” Ms. Jaafri said. In the country where the Arab Spring began, many Tunisians voice longing for a strong leader who can quickly make decisions and put the squabbling political class in its place. Human rights advocates have voiced alarm over what they see as the country’s authoritarian drift, manifested in prosecutions of politicians, journalists and activists who criticize the police and army. The protests in January were met with mass arrests. Analysts say they worry that the country is edging toward a model of autocracy similar to Egypt’s after a 2013 coup by the former military leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. “We’re moving close to that, very slowly,” said Fadil Aliriza, a Tunis-based analyst and journalist. “Whether we’re going to have some kind of violent rupture remains to be seen.”       Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
121,2018-05-03,"Trump Tweet Wasn&#8217;t a Threat to World Cup Bid, Says U.S. Soccer Chief",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/sports/soccer/03reuters-soccer-fifa-wcup-trump.html,484," By Reuters COPENHAGEN — The joint North American bid to host the 2026 World Cup has not been damaged by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent controversial tweet of support, bid co-chair Carlos Cordeiro told Reuters on Thursday. The U.S is bidding together with Canada and Mexico to host an expanded 48 team World Cup in 2026 but faces opposition from Morocco who have large support from African nations, as well as Russia and France.  The 211 football associations who make up FIFA’s membership will vote on the hosting rights in June. Last week Trump said in a tweet: ""It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S. bid. Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?"" FIFA responded by issuing a reminder of the ethics and code of conduct rules for bidding campaigns. Cordeiro said the tweet represented a welcome expression of support for the joint bid. ""I don’t see it as threatening. I think you have got to appreciate how he says things. I think what was implicit in what he said was that he would like to see people support our bid and that is what I like my head of state to say,"" Cordeiro, who is the president of the U.S. soccer federation, said. Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau both subsequently tweeted their own backing for the 2026 bid and Cordeiro said that showed the campaign had full political backing. “Mexico and Canada tweeted on the same day and no-one talks about their tweets. But the reality is that all three heads of states have been very vocal in support of our united bid. I think that is fantastic,” he said. U.S soccer officials have been meeting regularly with the Trump administration, including the President's son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner, a source close to the bid told Reuters. The source added that one of those meetings was just two days before Trump issued the tweet but said that the intervention on social media had not been discussed. Cordeiro, who was in Denmark to meet with Nordic soccer officials before leaving for further bid promotion events in Dubai, said he had not encountered any negative feedback from Trump's tweet. ""It doesn’t damage us,"" he said. ""We have had extensive conversations with the White House going back months, as have Canada and Mexico (with their governments). Why? Because FIFA require a number of assurances, warranties and guarantees on behalf of each of our governments in terms of access, taxes, work-permits, security, airport facilities – these are all part and parcel of submitting a bid which we did in March.  ""You do that with the cooperation of your government – we have had a lot of contact with them, including meetings last week,"" he said.

""The Vice President is delaying his trip to Brazil in order to ensure all diplomatic and national security resources are available as President Trump plans for his historic talks with the Kim regime,"" said Alyssa Farah, Pence's spokeswoman. No exact date or location has been announced for Trump’s meeting with Kim but it is expected to take place in late May or early June. Pence did not want divert any attention from the talks, Farah said. Pence’s trip had been expected to include a stop in Manaus, a city near the border with Venezuela. The Trump administration has been critical of Venezuela's government and has been weighing new sanctions against it. Pence had also been scheduled to visit Rio de Janeiro on May 30 and meet with Brazilian President Michel Temer and cabinet ministers in Brasilia on May 31, a Brazilian government source told Reuters last month. ""The vice president looks forward to traveling to Brazil in the near future and will continue to work closely with U.S. allies in Latin America to further strengthen our important alliances in the region,"" Farah said.

123,2018-05-03,"U.S. Factory Orders Rise, but Business Equipment Spending Slowing",https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-usa-economy-factory.html,408," By Reuters By Lucia Mutikani May 3 - New orders for U.S.-made goods rose more than expected in March, boosted by strong demand for transportation equipment and a range of other products, but there are signs that business spending on equipment is slowing. Factory goods orders rose 1.6 percent, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for February was revised up to show orders jumping 1.6 percent instead of the previously reported 1.2 percent increase. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 1.4 percent in March. Orders rose 7.7 percent on a year-on-year basis in March. Orders for transportation equipment increased 7.6 percent, lifted by a 44.5 percent jump in the volatile orders for civilian aircraft. Transportation orders rose 8.9 percent in February. Orders for machinery fell 1.9 percent, the largest drop since April 2016, after rising 0.6 percent in February. Orders for mining, oil field and gas field machinery surged 2.6 percent. Orders for motor vehicles fell 1.0 percent, the biggest drop since last July. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.6 percent while bookings for computers advanced 1.0 percent. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity, is being supported by strong domestic and global demand. But a shortage of skilled workers and rising commodity prices after the Trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are starting to impact production. A survey on Monday showed sentiment among manufacturers falling in April for a second straight month amid growing concerns about the tariffs, which were imposed by President Donald Trump in March. Manufacturers said the import duties had increased prices, made it difficult to source material and brought business planning to a standstill. That could undercut business spending on equipment.  Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum to shield domestic industries from what he has described as unfair competition from other countries. The Commerce Department revised March orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans, to show them falling 0.4 percent instead of dipping 0.1 percent as reported last month. Orders for these so-called core capital goods rose 1.0 percent in February. Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.8 percent in March instead of the 0.7 percent drop reported last month. Core capital goods shipments were up 1.2 percent in February.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
124,2018-05-03,"As Ridership Surges, Ferries to Get $300 Million to Expand Service",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/nyregion/mayor-de-blasio-ferry-nyc.html,778," By Patrick McGeehan Admitting that his administration vastly underestimated the appeal of heavily subsidized boat rides, Mayor Bill de Blasio is doubling down on his big investment in a commuter ferry service for New York City. Standing on a dock in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, on Thursday morning, Mr. de Blasio said he would commit an additional $300 million to expand the service and double the capacity of its fleet. City officials now project that NYC Ferry will attract as many as nine million riders annually, twice their initial forecast. “New Yorkers have spoken,” Mr. de Blasio said. “We’re going to need bigger boats.” Some of those regular riders have abandoned the overcrowded, problem-plagued subway system, which carries nearly six million riders per day. Others include new residents of thriving waterfront neighborhoods that are poorly served by traditional modes of mass transit, city officials said. Justin Brannan, a councilman from Brooklyn, praised the ferry service as a better option. “This is Bay Ridge, there’s two ways out: the R train and the Gowanus, and neither of them are pretty,” Mr. Brannan said, alluding to the traffic-clogged Gowanus Expressway. Among the changes city officials announced were the ordering of more large boats, the expansion of some of the busier docks and a rush-hour express run between the Rockaways and Lower Manhattan that would provide a nonstop cruise from one of the farthest reaches of the city to the financial district for the cost of a subway ride. Setting the ferry fare to match the $2.75 subway fare was an innovation of Mr. de Blasio’s administration. Before he took office, the city was subsidizing a limited ferry service on the East River that charged as much as $6 per ride. City officials estimate that the subsidy for NYC Ferry amounts to $6.60 per passenger. But Mr. de Blasio wanted to present the ferry service as an alternative to the subway. He committed about $390 million to build docks in waterfront neighborhoods that were poorly served by the city’s public transit system and to hire a company to build and operate a fleet of boats. The city launched the service a year ago and quickly found that it had underestimated demand. Last summer, the city had to scramble to charter boats larger than its fleet of 149-passenger vessels. City officials, who had argued against the need for bigger boats, relented and revised their order to include boats that can hold 350 passengers. Three of those larger boats are scheduled to arrive from a shipyard in Louisiana over the summer and three more are expected next year. In the meantime, Hornblower, the company that operates the ferries, will charter as many as eight boats that can carry up to 500 passengers each, said James Patchett, chief executive of the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Patchett said the chartered vessels would allow the city to narrow the gap between boats to 20 to 25 minutes on all four of its routes, down from 25 to 60 minutes last summer. But Mr. Patchett warned that he could not promise that demand would never again exceed the capacity of the ferries. “On a really crazy-beautiful day in the summer, when it seems like everyone in the city wants to go to the beach at the exact same time, there are still going to be lines,” he said. The service is scheduled to add two routes this summer, one starting in the Soundview section of the Bronx and the other on the Lower East Side. After those routes are established, city officials will decide where the ferries might go next, Mr. de Blasio said. “There’s a lot of places that would like ferry service,” he said. Mr. de Blasio disputed the idea that the investment in the ferry service would be better spent improving the subways and buses, which serve far more riders and some of the city’s lowest-income neighborhoods. He reiterated his view that the best solution for the subways would be a steady source of increased funding, such as an additional tax on the city’s wealthiest residents. “The answer is a long-term funding source that would allow us to fix the whole God-forsaken thing,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that he believed a different balance of power in the state Legislature this fall could provide sufficient support for a so-called millionaire’s tax. Standing on the dock in the sunshine, Mr. de Blasio refused to let the steady tide of questions from skeptical reporters erode his enthusiasm for the ferry service he deemed a resounding success. “We’ve got to do more than one thing to create a 21st-century city with multiple mass transit options for people,” the mayor said.

125,2018-05-03,Glencore's Congo Mining Conundrum,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-congo-glencore-mining.html,933," By Reuters LONDON/DAKAR — Miner and commodities trader Glencore is embroiled in a legal tangle over its copper and cobalt operations in Democratic Republic of Congo, where conflict and changes to regulations have deterred many mining firms. U.S. sanctions on Glencore's former Israeli partner in Congo have been a trigger for litigation. At the same time, relations with the Congolese authorities are under strain from a dispute with the government over a new mining code. Investors are watching closely, particularly for any impact on supplies of cobalt from Congo, which is by far the world's biggest producer of the metal whose uses include making alloys for jet engines and batteries for electric cars and mobile phones. Glencore accounts for more than a quarter of the world's cobalt output, most of it from Congo, which itself is the source of 60 percent of global supplies. Any disruption could push up cobalt prices from already historic highs of $90,000 (66,383 pounds) a tonne. <CBD3> ""The price would absolutely go through the roof,"" Bernstein analyst Paul Gait said. The copper price could also be affected by any disruption at Congolese mines but any impact is likely to be less dramatic as Congo is only the world's fifth biggest producer, analysts say. WHAT IS THE ROW ABOUT? Glencore's legal row revolves around its former partnership with Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire accused by Washington of using his friendship with Congolese President Joseph Kabila to secure sweetheart mining deals. Gertler denies any wrongdoing. Glencore has said the U.S. sanctions that were imposed in December mean it can no longer pay Gertler royalty payments. A company affiliated with Gertler has challenged this in court. In addition, Glencore's relations with its former business partner, state mining firm La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines (Gecamines), have been strained over the new mining code that raises taxes and royalty payments. Gecamines Chairman Albert Yuma has championed the new code, while Glencore and other foreign miners oppose the changes and have presented proposals to soften the new demands. The government has until now rejected these.  Glencore told its shareholders this week talks were continuing and a compromise could be reached. WHAT IS THE LATEST LEGAL SITUATION? Gecamines said on April 24 it had begun legal proceedings to wind up Kamoto Copper Company (KCC), one of Congo's biggest copper and cobalt mines that is a venture between Gecamines and Glencore's Katanga Mining. Gecamines said debts owed by KCC to Glencore and its subsidiaries at the end of 2017 topped $9 billion, and said the commodities group charged the venture interest rates on loans that were too high. Glencore denies this. Glencore said on April 22 Katanga was assessing options to deal with KCC's ""capital deficiency"", which could include converting some debt to equity or forgiving a portion of debt. Glencore Chairman Tony Hayward said on May 2 a recapitalisation of KCC could be successfully concluded.  On April 27, Glencore said its Congolese mining subsidiaries had been served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion by Ventora Development Sasu, a company affiliated with Gertler. Ventora is seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Glencore's unit Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from KCC. Glencore, which disputes the amounts, said Mutanda Mining and KCC would contest the freezing order and any subsequent proceedings. Glencore on May 1 won a temporary injunction against Gertler over the alleged unpaid royalties. Further hearings are expected in London on May 11 and in Congo on May 8. HOW DID THE ROYALTIES ISSUE ARISE? In February 2017, Glencore paid Gertler's Fleurette Group nearly $1 billion to boost its stake in the Mutanda and KCC copper and cobalt mines. Under the deal, Glencore pledged to pay royalties at a rate of 2.5 percent to Gertler's companies, which had bought the rights from Gecamines. These payments ceased after U.S. sanctions were imposed. Glencore owns 100 percent of Mutanda Mining and about 86 percent of Katanga Mining, which in turn has a 75 percent stake in KCC. HOW WILL GLENCORE SHARES REACT? Analysts and credit agencies say Congo risk is already factored into their view of Glencore, a diversified mining firm that has many operations around the world feeding into profits. RBC Capital Markets revised down its assessment of Glencore modestly on April 30, from ""top pick"" to ""outperform"", saying even now the company's shares were undervalued. It said any reduction in copper output could tip the world market into deficit this year, pushing up prices and helping Glencore's overall copper business. But Glencore's earnings could be hurt by a disruption to cobalt production in Congo. The company's cobalt output outside Africa in 2017 was just 3,500 tonnes compared with 23,900 tonnes from Congo and Zambia combined. CAN GLENCORE RESOLVE THE LEGAL ROW? Glencore has operated for years in Congo and places around the world that other companies deem too risky, so many analysts say its experience and size will help it resolve the issues. But Congo has seized assets held by Western firms in the past. In 2010, Congo seized the licence for the Kolwezi copper-cobalt project from First Quantum. The Canadian firm secured an agreement to resolve the issue in 2012 following international arbitration. Elisabeth Caesens, director of Brussels-based Resource Matters, a group advocating better global resource management, said Glencore's size might not be enough to protect it. ""Congolese authorities have cancelled fully operational projects in the past in less troubling circumstances,"" she said.

126,2018-05-03,UK's Brent Oilfields Halt Output Due to Terminal Closure,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-northsea-oil-brent.html,317," By Reuters LONDON — North Sea oilfields connected to the Brent oil pipeline have stopped production due to a shutdown at the UK's Sullom Voe oil terminal, the Brent pipeline operator said, reducing output of the crude which helps underpin a global pricing benchmark. The Brent stream is scheduled to load almost 100,000 barrels per day of crude in May and is usually the smallest of five crude grades that underpin the Brent benchmark, which is used to set prices worldwide. ""As a result of a shutdown at Sullom Voe Terminal, production has ceased from all Brent System and Ninian pipeline entrants, which includes all TAQA northern North Sea assets,"" oil company TAQA, which operates the Brent pipeline, said in an email. The terminal was expected to reopen on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter said. It was not possible to confirm the exact amount of production affected.  The incident follows unplanned outages of another crude grade underpinning the Brent benchmark, Forties, earlier this year and in 2017. The outage of Forties, much larger than Brent, helped boost world prices.  Brent is almost a quarter the size of the 400,000 bpd Forties system.  Sullom Voe terminal is operated by Enquest. A company spokesperson said it spotted a fault on Tuesday. ""During a routine visual inspection of the process pipework within the Sullom Voe Terminal, a minor defect was identified requiring immediate remedial work, which is underway,"" Enquest said. ""With safety as our top priority, we carried out a controlled shutdown of the incoming Brent and Ninian pipeline systems. There is no risk to people and no impact to the environment. We have advised Terminal users and will keep them regularly updated with progress."" Oil trading sources said earlier that one 600,000-barrel Brent cargo due to load in May has been dropped from the loading schedule and another was delayed into June.

127,2018-05-03,The Latest: Missouri to Hold Special Session on Greitens,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-missouri-governor-the-latest.html,713," By The Associated Press JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — The Latest on the investigation of Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (all times local): 7:58 p.m. The Missouri Legislature has called itself into a special session to consider impeaching Gov. Eric Greitens following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of charity resources. House and Senate leaders announced Thursday night that they had gathered petition signatures from more than three-fourths of all lawmakers in each chamber, which is the threshold required in the state constitution. The special session will start at 6:30 p.m. May 18 — just 30 minutes after the regular session ends. It will mark the first time in Missouri history that a Legislature has called itself into a special session. It comes as Greitens is facing two felony charges — one related to a 2015 extramarital affair and the other to using a charity donor list for his political campaign. ___ 6:45 p.m. The Missouri House has enough signatures to call a special session that could impeach Republican Gov. Eric Greitens. House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty told the Kansas City Star Thursday that 138 members had signed petition, more than the three-fourths threshold needed in the 165-seat chamber. Three-fourths of the Senate would also need to agree to a special session. More than one-third of senators from both parties have already called on the governor to resign in the wake of two felony charges. A spokeswoman for the Senate president pro tem confirmed that the Senate has the petition and is collecting signatures. Greitens faces his first criminal trial May 14 related to an invasion of privacy charge stemming from an extramarital affair he had before he took office. A House report released Wednesday also presented evidence that the governor filed false information with the Missouri Ethics Commission. ___ 4 p.m. The publisher of a political publication says he paid his own money to buy audiotapes made by the ex-husband of a woman who had an affair with Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens and that he intended to use them to write a book. Missouri Times publisher Scott Faughn, in a column Thursday, says he bought the recordings from Al Watkins, attorney for the ex-husband who secretly recorded his wife discussing the affair. Greitens goes to trial May 14 on an invasion of privacy charge stemming from the affair. Watkins told reporters last week he received two anonymous $50,000 payments in January and deduced they were to pay the ex-husband's legal fees. Watkins declined comment Thursday. Faughn did not immediately respond to questions about whether he provided $50,000 or the entire $100,000. ___ 11 a.m. Video cameras will not be allowed in the courtroom when Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens goes to trial later this month in St. Louis. Circuit Judge Rex Burlison on Thursday turned down a request from a lawyer working on behalf of several media outlets. But Burlison says he will consider allowing audio and still photos. Among other things, Burlison cited security concerns and the fact that the woman involved in the affair opposes video cameras in the courtroom. Greitens faces trial starting May 14 on an invasion of privacy charge stemming from an extramarital affair in 2015, before he was elected. He's accused of taking a partially nude and unauthorized photo of the woman while she was bound and blindfolded in the basement of his home. Mark Sableman, the attorney for the media organizations that include The Associated Press, says he is disappointed in the ruling, calling video an ""anti-spin antidote."" ___ 9:30 a.m. The Missouri House has spent at least $15,000 on court reporters to transcribe its work as it investigates allegations against Gov. Eric Greitens. Records provided to The Associated Press under the state Sunshine Law cover the first month of work by a special investigatory committee, from early March to early April. In addition to hiring court reporters, the records show the House had paid $240 to serve subpoenas to several witnesses. The House committee has continued to work since then. The panel released a report Wednesday indicating that Greitens used a donor list from a veterans' charity for his political campaign and then filed an Ethics Commission document falsely attributing its source to a campaign aide. It also released a report last month related to alleged sexual misconduct by Greitens.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
128,2018-05-03,Robots Help Artist Bring Fine Bison Hair to Pricey Paintings,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/technology/03reuters-technology-robot-art.html,250," By Reuters NEW YORK — American artist Barnaby Furnas has turned to a custom-made robot to help him with paintings that can sell for more than $100,000 at New York galleries. Furnas and several artists are using digital printing robots that use techniques in paintings that were previously impossible or too labor intensive. The machines are guided by inputs from artists and optical sensors to paint in fine detail in lines thinner than a human eyelash. ""I literally think of that robot as a friend,"" Furnas said in an interview. ""More than a pet, less than an art assistant - somewhere in there.""  He has used a robot called ""sozo,"" which means imagination in Japanese, for tasks such as painting thousands of hairs on a bison in one of his artworks. It leaves marks on a canvas according to his instructions that he communicates through an optical tracking system attached to a paintbrush-like rod. It records a painter's movements, allowing artists to edit brushstrokes before putting an image on a canvas. Those digital images can be combined with brushwork from an artist to bring new dimensions to a painting. Sozo was created by technology startup Artmatr, whose CEO Ben Tritt is a painter. He sees the company as an open-source community that will help artists merge digital technology with traditional painting methods. Besides Sozo, Artmatr also has a variety of machines that use ink jet heads found in printers. ""It lowers the risk threshold for individual mark making,"" Furnas said.

129,2018-05-03,Missouri to Hold Session to Consider Impeaching Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-missouri-governor.html,652," By The Associated Press JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — In a historic move, Missouri lawmakers announced Thursday that they are calling themselves into a special session later this month to consider impeaching Gov. Eric Greitens following allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of charity resources for his political campaign. Republican House and Senate leaders said they had gathered more than the constitutionally required signatures of three-fourths of the members of each chamber to summon themselves into a special session that will start at 6:30 p.m. on May 18 — just 30 minutes after the end of work in their regular session. It will mark the first time in Missouri history that lawmakers have called a special session. Extraordinary sessions typically are called by governors. ""This was not a decision made lightly and certainly not without great deliberation and effort,"" Missouri House Speaker Todd Richardson said. He pledged a ""fair process that will not be rushed to conclusion."" Various spokespeople for Greitens did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday night. The petition calls upon lawmakers to consider the upcoming recommendations of the House investigatory committee on potential ""disciplinary actions"" against the first-term Republican governor, which also could include lesser reprimands than impeachment. The special session petition was signed by 138 of the current 161 House members and 29 of the current 33 senators, Richardson said. Convening a special session will allow the investigatory committee to continue its work without worrying that it could be arbitrarily halted by the end of the regular session. According to the Missouri Constitution, the special session can last no more than 30 days. If the House votes to impeach Greitens, which requires 82 votes, the Senate then would appoint a panel of seven judges to conduct a trial on whether to remove him from office. Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard said he already has had conversations with retired judges about the process for putting together a trial panel. ""We stand ready to do it if called upon,"" he said. All of Missouri's top Republican and Democratic legislative leaders already had called on Greitens to resign, which he has declined to do. ""Pursuing impeachment against a Missouri governor is history none of us wants to make, but Eric Greitens' actions have made it unavoidable,"" said House Minority Leader Gail McCann Beatty. A spokeswoman for Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft confirmed the special session petition had been filed with the office Thursday night. Only one other Missouri official — former Democratic Secretary of State Judi Moriarty in 1994 — has been removed from office following impeachment. The legislative announcement about a special session came a day after a House investigatory committee released a report indicating that Greitens had misused a donor list from a veterans' charity he founded to raise money for his 2016 gubernatorial campaign. The report included testimony from a former Greitens' aide indicating the campaign also falsely identified the source of the donor list in a settlement with the Missouri Ethics Commission. It was the second stunning report from the House panel. Last month, it released a report with testimony from a woman alleging that Greitens had restrained, slapped, shoved, threatened and belittled her during a series of sexual encounters in 2015 that at times left her crying and afraid. Greitens faces a May 14 trial in St. Louis on a felony invasion of privacy indictment stemming from his encounter with the woman. He is accused of taking and transmitting a partially nude and unauthorized photo of the woman while she was bound and blindfolded in the basement of his home. Greitens has acknowledged having a consensual affair but has denied criminal wrongdoing. He also was charged April 20 in St. Louis with a felony charge of tampering with computer data for allegedly disclosing The Mission Continues donor list to a political fundraiser in 2015 without the permission of the St. Louis-based veterans' charity that he had founded.

130,2018-05-03,Correction: Zodiac Killer-DNA Story,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-zodiac-killer-dna.html,741," By The Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO — In a story May 3 about the Zodiac Killer investigation, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the killer was dubbed Zodiac because of astrological symbols he included in letters sent to police and media. The killer referred to himself as Zodiac in the letters. A corrected version of the story is below: DNA match sought to Zodiac Killer after break in other case California detectives want to use DNA tracing technology to try to zero in on the infamous Zodiac Killer after investigators used the method to arrest a suspect in another old serial killing case SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Northern California detectives still trying to identify the infamous Zodiac Killer who targeted victims in the late 1960s and taunted investigators with letters say they hope to try the same DNA tracing technology recently used to arrest a suspect in another string of cold-case serial slayings — those blamed on the Golden State Killer. But first they have to get a better DNA profile. Several months ago, the Vallejo Police Department sent two letters written by the Zodiac Killer to a private lab in hopes of finding his DNA on the back of the stamps or envelope flaps that may have been licked. They are expecting results soon. ""They were confident they would be able to get something off it,"" Vallejo police Detective Terry Poyser told the Sacramento Bee. Poyser said he hopes a full DNA profile will be found that will enable detectives to try the same DNA sleuthing techniques that were used to arrest Joseph DeAngelo last month. Authorities suspect he committed at least 12 murders and 50 rapes in California between 1976 and 1986. Investigators uploaded DNA collected at one of the crime scenes to an open-source genealogical website and found a partial match to a distant relative of DeAngelo's. From there, they painstakingly constructed a family tree dating back several generations before they zeroed in on DeAngelo. Some privacy advocates say they are concerned with the process and worry about future abuses, but detectives investigating the Zodiac Killer say they hope the technique will help solve one of the most vexing cold cases in the country. ""That's a great idea,"" said Gary Harmor, founder and director of the Serological Research Institute, a private DNA lab. ""I think we'll see more investigations use this technique."" Detectives in Southern California are testing DNA collected from a double-murder and rape to see if they can be tied to DeAngelo. Another man, Craig Coley, was recently cleared of those crimes after spending 38 years in prison in the murder of a 24-year-old college student and her 4-year-old son in 1978. The Zodiac Killer fatally stabbed or shot to death five people in Northern California in 1968 and 1969, then sent taunting letters and cryptograms to the police and newspapers. The Vallejo police are the lead investigators because the first two victims were killed there. The killer referred to himself as Zodiac in some of the letters. Various pieces of evidence, including a rope used to tie a victim as well as the letters, have been tested unsuccessfully for the killer's DNA profile. Poyser said recent advances in DNA testing prompted investigators to seek a match on two of the killer's letters. Vallejo Mayor Bob Sampayan said the samples were sent to the lab as a matter of routine. Sampayan, a former homicide detective, said police submit samples every couple of years in hopes that advances in DNA testing will finally yield a profile detectives can use. ""It was coincidental,"" Sampayan said of the new DNA test occurring at the same time as the breakthrough in the Golden State Killer case. ""There will come a time when we get a match,"" he said. The 2007 movie ""Zodiac,"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., renewed widespread interest in a case that has always had a cult following of amateur detectives and cryptographers who sought to crack the killer's code. One of those amateur sleuths, Tom Voigt, said the key to solving the Zodiac killings is mimicking the Golden State Killer investigation, which included forming a full-time task force dedicated to the case and exploiting publicly accessible DNA databases. Voigt said the Zodiac case was being investigated part time by a Police Department in a city that filed for municipal bankruptcy. ""There's a formula to follow,"" Voigt said. ""And it's to simply copy what happened to the Golden State Killer.""    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
131,2018-05-03,China Customs Expands Checks on U.S. Fruit Imports-Sources,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-usa-trade-china-fruits.html,708," By Reuters BEIJING/CHICAGO — China's major ports of entry have ramped up checks on fresh fruit imports from the United States, five Chinese industry sources said, which could delay shipments from U.S. growers already dealing with higher tariffs as Sino-U.S. trade ties worsen. Fruits were among 128 U.S. goods that China slapped with more expensive import tariffs in retaliation for U.S. levies on Chinese steel and aluminium as trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies flared this year. A U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is in Beijing for talks with Chinese officials. The two sides are expected to discuss an array of U.S. complaints about China's trade practices, from accusations of forced technology transfers to state subsidies for technology development. Since last week, Beijing has dispatched quarantine experts to major ports including Shanghai and Shenzhen to make more thorough on-site checks for disease and rot, a source based in Shanghai with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""China has resumed the practise of inspecting every batch of U.S. fresh fruit,"" the source said, adding that inspectors had previously checked only around 30 percent of shipments. China had dialled back the checks in November 2017.  Since Monday, all U.S.-originated fruit shipments have been subject to up to seven days of quarantine check on arrival in Shenzhen, said an industry source based at the port in China's south. Previously, customs officers in China had let shipments through while they conducted sample checks. Several containers of oranges imported by the source's company from the United States have been intercepted this week, the Shenzhen industry source added. China's customs office could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours.  Several batches of U.S apples have failed quarantine inspections and will be returned to the United States, the Shanghai source with direct knowledge of the matter said. Washington-based Chelan Fresh sales manager Bryan Peebles said he had heard of some shipment holdups, but that his export business, which includes apples and cherries, was not affected in recent weeks. ""There has been news of detaining of fruits – citrus and a little bit of apples,"" he said, adding that exporters will get a better handle on any heightened scrutiny when the year's first California cherry exports arrive in China this week. The United States sold $18 million (£13.2 million) of fresh apples to China in 2017 out of $872 million in total exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The more thorough inspections came as the cherry season on the U.S. West Coast kicked off. Shipments from Washington state typically begin in June. ""We're crossing our fingers and toes that everything will get worked out in the next month. China's a big market for us,"" said Randy Eckert, export sales manager for Washington-based Yakima Fresh LLC. If the measures remain in place, he fears a ""domino effect"" of cancelled orders by China and a rush by U.S. cherry growers to resell the perishable produce domestically or to other importers such as Canada. Likely days-long delays during the height of cherry shipping season this summer will raise the risk of spoilage at ports of entry, said Keith Hu, director of international operations for the industry group Northwest Cherry Growers. ""During the peak of our season, there is no way that they will have enough refrigerated storage for our cherries. The chances that our cherries will be destroyed under the sun is far greater,"" he said. ""We're looking at alternative markets."" China is the third-largest export market for fresh cherries from the United States. U.S. exporters shipped $119 million of fresh cherries to China, just under a third of total shipments worth $605 million in 2017. Fruits have previously been a casualty of bilateral trade spats. Several years ago, China banned some imports of Philippine fruits as bilateral ties deteriorated over a maritime territorial dispute in the South China Sea.  One Chinese online retailer that imports and sells U.S. cherries has suspended plans to promote U.S. fruits, a source at the company said.

132,2018-05-03,Boardroom Showdown Could Alter Telecom Italia's Future,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/business/03reuters-telecomitalia-elliott.html,935," By Reuters MILAN/LONDON — Warring investors will take their battle for boardroom control of Telecom Italia to a shareholder vote on Friday, with both sides promising major changes to reshape Italy's slumbering telecoms heavyweight. Hedge fund Elliott is leading a campaign to end top shareholder Vivendi's grip over Telecom Italia (TIM), blaming the French media group for TIM's faltering share price and serving its own interests. It is proposing an independent board, asset sales and a return of dividends. Vivendi accuses Elliott of proposing ""quick fixes"" and wants investors to back TIM's strategy, unveiled in March, including major investment in digital content, an internal modernisation and a plan to regain its investment grade credit rating. Both sides want to turn around Italy's biggest phone group, a heavily indebted former state phone monopoly that has underperformed bigger peers such as Deutsche Telekom, and Orange for years. TIM's enterprise value is nearly 20 percent below that of peers as a multiple of its forward EBITDA, it faces new rivals in both broadband and mobile, and its Brazilian business is only gradually recovering from economic malaise.  ""Tomorrow's AGM is a key catalyst in Telecom Italia's equity story (although) the fundamental outlook remains difficult,"" said UBS analyst Giovanni Montalti, who has a 'neutral' rating on the stock. Graphic: Telecom Italia share price vs peers - https://reut.rs/2JNHd6f Other shareholders say the best outcome would be for Vivendi and Elliott to bury the hatchet and allow a more independent board to push through measures to slash its net debt of more than 25 billion euros (22 billion pounds), tackle competition and unlock value. ""Whatever slate wins at the AGM, a settlement between the two groups would be the most desirable outcome, agreeing on the key levers to create value for shareholders with a stable board of directors supportive of (CEO Amos) Genish,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note. The broker has an 'overweight' rating on TIM. Elliott has built a stake of 9 percent to try change the way Vivendi, which owns 24 percent, is running the company. New York-headquartered Elliott Management Corp manages assets of about $35 billion and is pushing for change at Telecom Italia through its London-based affiliate Elliott Advisors (UK). Friday's shareholder vote will pit the two against each other in a bid to secure the majority of TIM's 15-member board. Whatever the outcome, the two adversaries will have to co-exist with the loser bound to get the remaining five seats.  ""This could be the beginning of a new era for TIM,"" a source close to the company said. ""If played well, Genish could have the chance to work in a less hostile environment.""  Since becoming a shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has gradually tightened its grip on TIM, appointed the majority of its board last year and named its own CEO as TIM's executive chairman - all in the name of French tycoon Vincent Bollore's stated ambition to build a southern European media powerhouse.  Two TIM CEOs left because of clashes with the French investor.  The hands-on approach has led to friction with politicians in Rome, concerned about an asset they consider strategic, and has unnerved other investors at the telecoms firm. But Vivendi also brought in Genish, who managed to impress investors and the government in Rome, and whose ambitious new three-year strategy, presented in March, was welcomed. Last week shareholders nearly unanimously backed the new CEO who, despite being a Vivendi ally, is well respected for his track record in the telecoms industry. ""Genish staying is key to providing stability and execution of the business plan, particularly given the replacement of three top executives in the last three years,"" Morgan Stanley said.  TRUMP CARD On Friday, shareholders will have to pick between Elliott's slate of 10 independent Italian business heavyweights and Vivendi's list, which did little to allay governance concerns.  Proxy advisers recommended backing Elliott's slate, saying Vivendi had been damaging for governance and investor returns. Italian state lender CDP bought 4.8 percent of TIM, a move widely seen as political endorsement of the Elliott campaign.  But Vivendi's trump card is having Genish on its list, which might prove a conundrum for some who may want to weaken the French grip but will not want to lose the CEO.  Genish has said his position would be ""untenable"" if TIM ended up with a board that did not back his business plan.  Elliott has repeatedly said it supports Genish and his plan.  It also toned down its requests for major strategy moves, saying management and the independent board would evaluate whether and when to carry them out. The fund had originally called for selling a controlling stake in the soon-to-be-created network company, a return to dividends and the conversion of savings shares -- all measures TIM management called premature, unfeasible and carrying financial risks.  If it loses on Friday, Vivendi has no wish to exit its 4 billion euro ($4.8 billion) TIM investment anytime soon and ""the fight will continue"", a source close to the matter said.  TIM has often been seen as a pawn in other people's games. Before Vivendi came in, TIM was controlled by a holding company that included Italian investors and Spain's Telefonica. With Genish in charge, investors hope things could change. ""There is a lot of unrealised value in Telecom Italia and Vivendi and Elliott need to agree on a compromise, maybe brokered by Genish -- otherwise TIM gets bogged down in this boardroom battle and once again nothing gets done,"" said a fund manager at a U.S. fund that also owns TIM shares.

133,2018-05-03,U.S. Prisoner Release Would Be Goodwill Move by North Korea: White House,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/03/world/asia/03reuters-northkorea-usa.html,808," By Reuters WASHINGTON — The White House said on Thursday it would welcome the release of three Americans imprisoned in North Korea as a goodwill gesture before a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but that it could not confirm reports that they are about to be freed.  Expectations have grown that North Korea would soon release the three ahead of the unprecedented summit in the coming weeks. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's new main lawyer, told Fox News Channel that Pyongyang would release them as early as Thursday.  It was not immediately clear whether Giuliani had direct knowledge of negotiations around the issue. CNN, citing an unnamed source, said on Thursday the prisoners' release was imminent, adding the groundwork for the move was laid two months ago when North Korea's foreign minister traveled to Sweden and proposed the idea. ""We can't confirm the validity of any of the reports currently out about their release, but we certainly would see this as a sign of goodwill if North Korea were to release the three Americans ahead of discussions between President Trump and Kim Jong Un,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters. The three are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong Chul, arrested in 2015; Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak Song, who also taught at PUST and was detained in 2017. Trump did not mention Korea or the prisoners when he spoke at a prayer event at the White House on Thursday. ""Our country is doing very well. You'll see some very good announcements very shortly,"" he said. On Wednesday, Trump said on Twitter, ""As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!""  But of the three, only Kim Dong Chul was arrested before Trump became president in January 2017. The U.S. government is looking into reports that the Americans had recently been relocated from a labor camp to a hotel near Pyongyang, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.  The summit between Trump and Kim is expected to take place in late May or early June.  DENUCLEARIZATION In preparing for the summit, Trump's administration has said it wants North Korea's ""complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization"" but has offered few details of the strategy it will employ at the talks.  Kim told the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, on Thursday that he is committed to denuclearization, China's foreign ministry said, as diplomatic efforts to bring lasting peace to the Korean peninsula gather pace. ""Kim Jong Un said achieving the denuclearization of the peninsula is the firm position of the North Korean side,"" China's foreign ministry said after Wang met Kim in Pyongyang.  North Korea announced on Sunday that it would close its main nuclear test site next month but some U.S. officials are skeptical that Pyongyang will give up its nuclear arsenal. Trump has promised to ensure that North Korea does not get the capability to build a nuclear bomb that can hit the mainland United States.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is postponing his plans to travel to Brazil this month in order to ensure foreign policy resources are focused on Trump's talks with Kim, Pence's spokeswoman said. The exact date and location has yet to be fixed for the meeting between Trump and Kim, who lobbed personal insults and lambasted each other last year over North Korea's nuclear arms ambitions. The change in tone has been helped by last week's meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, at which the two pledged to work for ""complete denuclearization"" of the Korean peninsula. Trump said he would maintain pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions ahead of his own meeting with Kim. Even as Washington presses for the release of the three American prisoners, the parents of a U.S. college student who died last year soon after being release from captivity in North Korea have sued Pyongyang over their son's death, saying Otto Warmbier was ""brutally tortured and murdered."" Warmbier's parents told a meeting at the United Nations on Thursday that they would no longer be silent and believed they had to stand up for their son and other families whose loved ones had been abducted by North Korea.  ""The only thing we can do is rub their noses in this. It embarrasses them,"" said Cindy Warmbier, Otto's mother. ""You can't negotiate. You just have to shame them.""

134,2018-05-03,NBC News Corrects Story on Monitoring Cohen's Phones,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/03/us/ap-us-tv-nbc-cohen.html,249," By The Associated Press NEW YORK — NBC News corrected a story Thursday that said federal investigators had placed a wiretap on the phone lines of President Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, saying it subsequently learned that the feds were only monitoring the source of calls and weren't listening in. The correction gives ammunition to the nation's highest-ranked media critic. Trump has frequently criticized the media for ""fake news"" involving stories he doesn't like. NBC moved its original story online shortly after 1 p.m. on Thursday, and it became immediate fodder on MSNBC and other cable networks. The correction was issued online at 5:27 p.m. with an editor's note to the rewritten story, and was discussed on MSNBC's ""Meet the Press Daily."" The network had attributed its original story to two anonymous sources with knowledge of the legal proceedings against Cohen. Tom Winter, one of NBC's investigative reporters, said the sources have a track record of providing reliable information. But NBC said that three senior U.S. officials — also not identified — had disputed the account. They said the phones were monitored by a pen register, which keeps a log of phone numbers on both ends of the conversation, but does not hear the audio. ""It's still a very serious matter,"" Winter told NBC colleague Chuck Todd, noting that a judge had to sign off on placement of the pen register. ABC News tweeted that it had confirmed the original wiretap story. But it later sent a corrected tweet and deleted the old one.    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS"
